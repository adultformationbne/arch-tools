Title: 

Being a Seeker and Proclaimer of Truth 

Gospel quote: 

‘Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man.’ (Mk 6:20) 

Reflection written by:

In today’s Gospel we see the best and worst of human nature. 

 

Herodias’ simmering resentment and bitterness, the corrupting influence of power, and Herod’s disordered desire to safeguard his reputation, all culminate in injustice and tragedy. 

 

In stark contrast stands John the Baptist. Unlike Herodias and Herod, he wields no power, yet he is compelled to proclaim truth. While it is easy to identify with John the Baptist, the hero of this story, I must admit there have been times when I have deliberately chosen not to proclaim the truth. 

 

Protecting my own reputation or avoiding embarrassment has sometimes prevented me from sharing what I know to be true. There have also been instances where I have harboured unforgiveness, acting in ways that have caused harm to others. John the Baptist, however, prioritised loving others above himself, even to the point of death. 

 

John the Baptist is remembered as a ‘righteous and holy man’ because he lived as a seeker and proclaimer of truth. He focused solely on pleasing God, rather than seeking the adoration of others.  

 

Lord, 

I know true peace comes from putting you above all things. Help me to be a proclaimer of truth and to tell others the good news of your love for all of us. Amen.
