In these works, faith in a divine being is dismissed as infantile, divisive and destructive.

The way we pray is less important than the fact that we do it. Spending time in prayer necessarily means that we forego other activities and experiences. We must make a choice and still our restlessness. As one spiritual writer, Fr. Ron Rolheiser observed: Because prayer can seem unreal, we often stop doing it, but it will only seem real if we persevere in it long enough and do it deeply enough. We often give up too soon. Prayer isn’t easy. It’s hard to sit still and (seemingly) do nothing when so many necessary tasks demand our attention and when so much inside us aches for activity and involvement. It’s hard to pray when we suffer from the kind of headaches and heartaches that cannot be eased by taking an Aspirin. But prayer beckons us beyond, asking us to lift even this up to God.",

We might just note at this point that Protestant versions of the Bible contain 66 books, acknowledging only 39 Old Testament books as the true word of God, seven fewer than are found in the Catholic Bible. This is because Catholics follow the early Greek manuscripts of the Bible, while Protestants accept only the books found in the ancient Hebrew manuscripts.

However, overall, the Jews were fiercely monotheistic and would have found such a concept very difficult to accept, because it would seem to put at risk their belief in God’s oneness, a truth that was so basic to their religion. Their pagan neighbours were polytheists, worshippers of many gods. This practice was abhorrent to the Jews. Their monotheism or belief in one God was the distinctive mark which set them apart, and made their worship so much superior to the idolatrous practices of other peoples.

We are told that Jesus had no natural human father, but that Mary conceived her son by the supernatural intervention of the Holy Spirit. Mary at the time was preparing to marry a man named Joseph, to whom God revealed the extraordinary circumstances of his fiancee’s pregnancy. Then Joseph consented to take Mary as his wife, and become the legal father of the child. The child was given the name Jesus (in Hebrew, Yeshua or Yehoshua), a name which means ‘God saves’.",

After feeding the 5000 people (John 6:1-15), Jesus explained to his disciples that he was the bread of life ... living bread that came down from heaven (John 6:48, 51). He went on to say that the bread that he was giving for the life of the world was his flesh, and that it was necessary to eat his flesh and drink his blood to have eternal life (6:48, 51, 53-54). Many of his followers were unable to accept this teaching and parted company with him. Jesus asked the Twelve whether they too wanted to leave. Peter, speaking on their behalf, said: Lord, to whom can we go? You have the words of eternal life (John 6:68).",

To ensure that the basic message of Jesus as taught by the apostles was preserved in its integrity, and not falsified or distorted by false teachers, the writer urged the careful selection and appointment of local church leaders and officials. It would be their primary duty to pass on the apostolic tradition as they had received it, and to protect it from all errors.

This picture of a pilgrim people travelling towards the promised land comes through strongly in the first letter of Peter. This letter written from Rome to Gentile Christians in a remote part of the Empire, addresses them as ‘exiles.’ (1:1); They evidently felt isolated from the surrounding society and were ostracised by their pagan neighbours. The writer therefore reassures them of the new dignity they possess as God’s people, and reminds them that in the Church they have found a new home and a new family.

Now the risen Christ invites him to make reparation for this triple denial. Three times he asks Peter, do you love me more than these? When Peter insistently declares his love, he is told that his duty and function is to feed Christ’s lambs and sheep, that is, to be shepherd or pastor to all who will come to believe in Jesus (John 21:15-17).",

A careful study of the New Testament reveals a gradual development in understanding of the importance of Mary in God’s plan. The earliest New Testament writings do not assign to her any special significance. The first New Testament ‘books’ to be written were the letters of Paul, which were composed in the 50’s of the first century, and therefore only 20-30 years after the death and resurrection of Jesus. In these letters, the mother of Jesus is mentioned only once, and even then not by name (Galatians 4:4). Similarly, the first Gospel to be written, the Gospel of Mark (c. 65 AD), begins with John the Baptist introducing Jesus to the people as an adult about to begin his public ministry. There are no infancy narratives in Mark, no stories about events connected with the conception, birth or childhood of Jesus. This shows that the gospel message in the early years of the Church was proclaimed without any concentration on, or perhaps even reference to, the role of Mary.",

While his mother was concerned about the scarcity of material wine, Jesus is thinking of the messianic wine – that is, the messianic age. More than once in the Scriptures, the messianic kingdom is described as a banquet feast, when wine will flow in abundance.",

But as the end of his public life draws nearer, he realises that the hour has arrived. In 12:23, Jesus says: The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. In 13:1, John says that Jesus knew the hour had come for him to pass from this world to the Father. And he begins his beautiful prayer in chapter 17, recited on the eve of his death, with the words, Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you (17:1).",

As various forms of Christian witness developed, the conviction that Mary remained always a virgin came to be held as Catholic doctrine. The Gospels leave undecided the question of the ‘brothers’ and ‘sisters’ of Jesus (Mark 6:3). Holding onto the idea of Mary’s virginity, the ancient Church fathers (early Christian writers) interpreted these passages in various ways. Some, for example, particularly in the East, suggested that Joseph married Mary as an elderly widower and already had children of his own. Others suggested that the terms ‘brothers’ and ‘sisters’ were best understood to mean ‘cousins’ and broader kindred, and it is this interpretation which has become the standard. By the 4th century, particularly through the writings of St Jerome, the Church had come to see Mary’s life-long virginity as part of her commitment to her Son and his mission.",

Our love should not be just words or talk, but must be sincere and show itself in action. James in his letter tells us that faith without works is also dead (James 2:26). This is his conclusion to an argument in which he asks what good is it for someone to say that he has faith if his actions do not prove it. Such faith will not save a person, James warns: If a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food, and one of you says to them, ‘Go in peace; keep warm and eat your fill’, and yet you do not supply their bodily needs, what is the good of that? So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead (James 2:14-17).

According to Luke, Paul up to this point had been a persecutor of the followers of Jesus. Now in his confusion, he asked: Who are you, Lord? And the reply he received was: I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting (Acts 9:4-5). Luke’s description of the circumstances of Paul’s conversion may explain the identification of Christ with the Church that we find in his letters.

John positively reminds us that those who say they have not sinned deceive themselves (see 1 John 1:8-10). Membership of the Church does not ensure sinlessness, but is a call to holiness and perfection (see Matthew 5:48) and to promoting and advancing God’s kingdom (see Matthew 6:10). By responding to this call, the members of the Church help to build up the Body of Christ so that it becomes more and more the sacrament of Christ in the world.",

His first miracle in John’s Gospel was to change water into wine (John 2:1-11), and later he multiplied bread and fish to feed the hungry crowd (Mark 6:35-44; 8:19). By action and gesture, he communicated the grace and power of God. He often touched people when he healed them, even lepers (Mark 1:40-45), and used clay and spittle to open a blind man’s eyes (Mark 8:22-26). He breathed on his disciples to give them the Holy Spirit (John 20:22), and on the night before he died, he made use of bread and wine to give them his body and blood (Mark 14:22-25).",
