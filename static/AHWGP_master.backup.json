It must also be said that doubt is distinct from a denial of faith. As some of the great mystics and spiritual writers throughout history have expressed, doubt is a companion of faith.

In these works, faith in a divine being is dismissed as infantile, divisive and destructive. For Dawkins, Hitchens and other publicly-avowed atheists, only the rational and scientifically discernible world is credible. Any statement of faith beyond this is a delusion. Dawkins, Hitchens and companions are best understood as social iconoclasts attempting to shatter what they see as illusions and shadows opposed to human reason.

By seeing the works and hearing the words of the man Jesus, we gain an insight into the character of God that was otherwise unknown and unknowable – God’s love, compassion and mercy, God’s care and concern for individuals, especially the poor, the sick, the weak, the outcasts, those whom Jesus called God’s ‘little ones’.",

We are given a glimpse of him at prayer before or during some of the most crucial events of his life: after his baptism, before choosing the Twelve, alone on the mountain in hiding from people who wanted to proclaim him their king, and above all, during his agony of fear in the garden of Gethsemane the night before his death.",

And yet in his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground (Luke 22:43-44). One of the best aids to prayer is to try to enter into Jesus’ feelings at different occasions of his life, for his human feelings are our feelings too.",

There is no room and no point for the camouflage and the masks I may put on in my relationship with others. I am myself, with nothing hidden from God, but also with nothing that God does not care for. It is preparing oneself for prayer that is the real problem, rather than the actual praying.

We must make a choice and still our restlessness. As one spiritual writer, Fr. Ron Rolheiser observed: Because prayer can seem unreal, we often stop doing it, but it will only seem real if we persevere in it long enough and do it deeply enough. We often give up too soon. Prayer isn’t easy. It’s hard to sit still and (seemingly) do nothing when so many necessary tasks demand our attention and when so much inside us aches for activity and involvement. It’s hard to pray when we suffer from the kind of headaches and heartaches that cannot be eased by taking an Aspirin. But prayer beckons us beyond, asking us to lift even this up to God.",

It is prayer which has the advantage of simplicity and is meant to be repeated, rhythmically, without haste and from the heart. Because of its rhythmic character, it is often called ‘breath prayer’ or ‘breathing prayer’.",

God’s truth is one and indivisible, and the Bible and the Church are closely related to each other.

We might just note at this point that Protestant versions of the Bible contain 66 books, acknowledging only 39 Old Testament books as the true word of God, seven fewer than are found in the Catholic Bible.

There is a diverse range of resources available, both in print and online, that can assist anyone to understand and appreciate the different books of the Bible.

They began to preach the gospel and to attract large numbers of converts to this new religious movement. They proclaimed the message of salvation brought by Jesus first to the Jewish people, and in doing so they also made use of the scriptures which had long been sacred to the Jews – what we call the Old Testament. Like their fellow Jews and their Jewish ancestors, the followers of Jesus accepted these scriptures as the word of God. In quoting from these scriptures in his early sermons, Peter would say: This is how the Holy Spirit spoke through the mouths of the prophets in days of old (2 Peter 1:19-21).",

Two that come to mind are the ‘words of institution’ at the end of the Last Supper (Matthew 26:26-27 and parallels) and the ‘primacy of Peter’ text of Matthew (16:17-19).

The Jews had no concept of a God of three persons, although the Hebrew scriptures do contain hints of a sense of plurality in God and suggestions of divergent understandings and traditions. However, overall, the Jews were fiercely monotheistic and would have found such a concept very difficult to accept, because it would seem to put at risk their belief in God’s oneness, a truth that was so basic to their religion. Their pagan neighbours were polytheists, worshippers of many gods. This practice was abhorrent to the Jews. Their monotheism or belief in one God was the distinctive mark which set them apart, and made their worship so much superior to the idolatrous practices of other peoples. From John’s Gospel especially we learn that fellow Jews on several occasions accused Jesus of blasphemy because they understood his claim to be equal to his Father as a claim to be God.",

The sacrifice of Jesus, at the same time Son of God and the perfect, representative human, thus had an infinite power and was alone able to repair the injury committed against God by the world’s sin. This theological model of atonement found its most systematic expression in the works of St Anselm in the 11th century and was to shape centuries of theological reflection.",

Certainly the people of Israel, before the time of Christ, were convinced of God’s love for them. There is abundant evidence in the Old Testament that they recognised the God of Israel as a God of love. But the life and death of Jesus, God’s Son, demonstrates the divine love to an extent that we could not otherwise imagine or suspect. When we look at the cross of Jesus and reflect on its meaning, we see the love of God revealed in full clarity.",

As a result of the life and ministry and teaching of Jesus, God is no longer a remote, transcendent Being, separated from us by an unbridgeable gap, but someone who shares our life. When we see Jesus in action and listen to his words, we receive a much clearer and deeper insight into God’s own character, what God is really like. We learn especially that this is a God who knows each creature as an individual; a God who loves and cares for each one of us; who has a special concern for the weak, the sick, the suffering, those whom Jesus called God’s ‘little ones’; and who is a God of mercy and compassion, who desires the conversion of the sinner and takes special delight in forgiving.",

Jesus was born more than 2000 years ago, in the little town of Bethlehem, in Judaea (the southern part of present day Israel). His mother was a Jewish girl named Mary from the village of Nazareth, in Galilee (in the north of modern Israel). The Gospels of Matthew and Luke both refer to the miraculous nature of his conception. We are told that Jesus had no natural human father, but that Mary conceived her son by the supernatural intervention of the Holy Spirit. Mary at the time was preparing to marry a man named Joseph, to whom God revealed the extraordinary circumstances of his fiancee’s pregnancy. Then Joseph consented to take Mary as his wife, and become the legal father of the child. The child was given the name Jesus (in Hebrew, Yeshua or Yehoshua), a name which means ‘God saves’.",

After feeding the 5000 people (John 6:1-15), Jesus explained to his disciples that he was the bread of life ... living bread that came down from heaven (John 6:48, 51). He went on to say that the bread that he was giving for the life of the world was his flesh, and that it was necessary to eat his flesh and drink his blood to have eternal life (6:48, 51, 53-54). Many of his followers were unable to accept this teaching and parted company with him. Jesus asked the Twelve whether they too wanted to leave. Peter, speaking on their behalf, said: Lord, to whom can we go? You have the words of eternal life (John 6:68).",

This idealised vision of the Church has its basis in the Old Testament where the love relationship between God and his people is also described in marriage, with God the bridegroom and Israel the bride.

To ensure that the basic message of Jesus as taught by the apostles was preserved in its integrity, and not falsified or distorted by false teachers, the writer urged the careful selection and appointment of local church leaders and officials. It would be their primary duty to pass on the apostolic tradition as they had received it, and to protect it from all errors.

They seek the things of heaven, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God, as they wait for the full revelation of Christ to take place (Colossians 3:1-4). This picture of a pilgrim people travelling towards the promised land comes through strongly in the first letter of Peter. This letter written from Rome to Gentile Christians in a remote part of the Empire, addresses them as ‘exiles.’ (1:1); They evidently felt isolated from the surrounding society and were ostracised by their pagan neighbours. The writer therefore reassures them of the new dignity they possess as God’s people, and reminds them that in the Church they have found a new home and a new family. Once you were not a people, but now you are God’s people, for you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people (1 Peter 2:9-10).",

Now the risen Christ invites him to make reparation for this triple denial. Three times he asks Peter, do you love me more than these? When Peter insistently declares his love, he is told that his duty and function is to feed Christ’s lambs and sheep, that is, to be shepherd or pastor to all who will come to believe in Jesus (John 21:15-17).",

In an encyclical (official letter) written in 1995, St John Paul II acknowledged that historical manifestations of the primacy of Rome had at times been the cause of division rather than be an expression of unity. In light of this, St John Paul II issued a call for a dialogue between churches on the manner in which the primacy of the Bishop of Rome was exercised.",

Perhaps this wrong impression arose because the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) did not devote a special document to Mary, as some of the Council Fathers wished. Instead the Council treated her in a chapter (ch. 8, the final chapter) of the Constitution on the Church. As we shall see, this is surely the right perspective and the right context in which to see the role of Mary, mother of Jesus and our mother.",

It mentioned the unique dignity of the mother of God, but also stated that Catholics should avoid the falsity of exaggeration on the one hand, and the excess of narrow mindedness on the other (no 67). So while beliefs about Mary should not be considered as equal in importance to the fundamental Christian truths about the nature of God and redemption, nor should Mary’s important role in God’s plan of salvation be ignored or neglected. The proper Catholic balance of Marian devotion is to consider Mary both in her privileged relationship to Jesus and her symbolic relationship to the Church as a model and woman of faith.",

      "content": "We turn now to look closely at what the Scriptures tell us about Mary’s role in God’s plan of salvation. A careful study of the New Testament reveals a gradual development in understanding of the importance of Mary in God’s plan. The earliest New Testament writings do not assign to her any special significance. The first New Testament ‘books’ to be written were the letters of Paul, which were composed in the 50’s of the first century, and therefore only 20-30 years after the death and resurrection of Jesus. In these letters, the mother of Jesus is mentioned only once, and even then not by name (Galatians 4:4). Similarly, the first Gospel to be written, the Gospel of Mark (c. 65 AD), begins with John the Baptist introducing Jesus to the people as an adult about to begin his public ministry. There are no infancy narratives in Mark, no stories about events connected with the conception, birth or childhood of Jesus. This shows that the gospel message in the early years of the Church was proclaimed without any concentration on, or perhaps even reference to, the role of Mary.",

Naturally, Mary figures prominently in these infancy narratives (Matthew 1-2, Luke 1-2), especially in Luke’s version of events. Luke introduces Mary into his narrative in a passage (1:26-38) which describes the event commonly known as ‘The Annunciation’. In this story God reveals to Mary, through Gabriel, his angel or messenger, that he has chosen her to be the mother of his Son. Mary emerges from this account as a model for us of faith and of obedience to God’s will. These qualities are summed up in her sublime response to God’s message: Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word (Luke 1:38).",

On this occasion Luke attributes to Mary a beautiful song of joy and praise of God, known (from its opening word in Latin) as the Magnificat.

To Mary, Simeon addressed the words a sword will pierce your own soul too (2:35).

He became separated from them, and Luke tells us he was missing for three days. On finding him, in the temple, Mary in her anxiety complained: Child, why have you treated us like this? Look, your father and I have been searching for you in great anxiety. To which Jesus replied: Why were you searching for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?

But as the end of his public life draws nearer, he realises that the hour has arrived. In 12:23, Jesus says: The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. In 13:1, John says that Jesus knew the hour had come for him to pass from this world to the Father. And he begins his beautiful prayer in chapter 17, recited on the eve of his death, with the words, Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you (17:1).",

We say in the Creed, I look forward to the resurrection of the dead. Put simply, this is what is at the heart of the doctrine of the Assumption.

As various forms of Christian witness developed, the conviction that Mary remained always a virgin came to be held as Catholic doctrine. The Gospels leave undecided the question of the ‘brothers’ and ‘sisters’ of Jesus (Mark 6:3). Holding onto the idea of Mary’s virginity, the ancient Church fathers (early Christian writers) interpreted these passages in various ways. Some, for example, particularly in the East, suggested that Joseph married Mary as an elderly widower and already had children of his own. Others suggested that the terms ‘brothers’ and ‘sisters’ were best understood to mean ‘cousins’ and broader kindred, and it is this interpretation which has become the standard. By the 4th century, particularly through the writings of St Jerome, the Church had come to see Mary’s life-long virginity as part of her commitment to her Son and his mission.",

Our love should not be just words or talk, but must be sincere and show itself in action. James in his letter tells us that faith without works is also dead (James 2:26). This is his conclusion to an argument in which he asks what good is it for someone to say that he has faith if his actions do not prove it. Such faith will not save a person, James warns: If a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food, and one of you says to them, ‘Go in peace; keep warm and eat your fill’, and yet you do not supply their bodily needs, what is the good of that? So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead (James 2:14-17).

At other times we are not aware of God’s loving presence, only realising it later. We may have also discovered that God can be present to us in unlikely places and in unexpected ways. Truly, our God is a ‘God of surprises’!\nIn your reflection to prepare for the next session:\nRecall some time(s) when you were clearly aware of God’s presence (even if that awareness only came later, on reflection).\nThese questions may help you: How old were you? Where were you living? What happened? What difference did it make to your life? How do you see it now?",

According to Luke, Paul up to this point had been a persecutor of the followers of Jesus. Now in his confusion, he asked: Who are you, Lord? And the reply he received was: I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting (Acts 9:4-5). Luke’s description of the circumstances of Paul’s conversion may explain the identification of Christ with the Church that we find in his letters. It was Paul who introduced the image of the Church as the body of Christ.",

In the same Constitution (no. 59), the Council summed up the purpose of the sacraments: The purpose of the sacraments is to sanctify people, to build up the body of Christ, and to give worship to God. Because they are signs, they also instruct. They not only presuppose faith, but they also nourish, strengthen and express it.",

Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells within me (Romans 7:19-20). As we think about who we are and how we live, we realise that, despite our best intentions, something goes awry. As much as we desire God, we do, in small and large ways, reject God’s goodness in our life. We only need to look at the world to realise that for all this world’s beauty and joy, there also lurks a terrible darkness and despair. Where does this come from?",

Prior to any decisions we make as human beings, there is an inclination active within us to make choices away from what is ultimately good and true and beautiful. We live with the incapacity to fully embrace what is of God. We have a longing for God, for the Infinite, but we live in a world which requires finite choices. This necessity to make decisions and choices about who we are and how we live is hindered and mired by this incapacity to fully reach for the Love which calls to us. Our fear of finitude and death narrows our response to the Infinite. We turn away from Love and seek fulfilment in the ‘here and now’ and we frequently turn that which is positive in our lives into means of destruction. Respect can become envy, passion can become violence, desire can become obsession, pleasure can become addiction, and self-esteem can become self-centredness. History teaches us that human beings and human societies can swing wildly out of control and commit the most horrendous crimes and cruelties. There is no clearer example of ‘original sin’ than the damage that human beings have wreaked on one another in both spontaneous and calculated ways throughout the course of time.",

However, there are some Christian communities which demand that Baptism be deferred until the person is able to make his or her own decision for Christ. For this reason, infant Baptism is not universally practised among Christians today.",

      "content": "It is the same gift of God’s love and life which the baptised person receives at Confirmation. The candidate renews his or her baptismal promises, and the bishop (or delegated priest) anoints the candidate on the forehead with fragrant Chrism (consecrated) oil, saying the words: Be sealed with the gift of the Holy Spirit. To be ‘sealed’ means to be authoritatively marked or stamped as someone’s property. The oil is the sign of the strength which the sacrament gives. The ‘gift of the Holy Spirit’, a share in God’s life and love, is of course a single gift, but it will manifest itself in a multitude of ways. A traditional list of ‘gifts’ of the Spirit is taken from the prophecy of Isaiah (11:2-3), where the prophet numbers seven gifts. It should be remembered that the number seven in biblical symbolism stands for fullness, completeness and perfection. In the rite of Confirmation the bishop or his delegate prays that the candidates should receive the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and fortitude, the spirit of knowledge and piety; ... [and] the spirit of the fear of the Lord.",

Baptism and Confirmation draw us into Christ’s life, and empower us to continue his saving work. They are signs that our lives have been radically influenced by Christ, and the demands they make as far as conversion (radical change) is concerned are constant. But these sacraments also assure us that we are never alone on our pilgrimage, and that God – Father, Son and Holy Spirit – is our constant companion. The whole of Christian life is not captured in singular sacramental moments but experienced and expressed throughout the life-long journey of deepening of our relationship with Jesus. Real Christian initiation continues throughout all the days of our life.",

Sad to say there are those who worship God out of a sense of fear. ‘Fear of the Lord’ has its place in a person’s religious outlook, but it should never be the main motivation for worship. Others approach their worship in the spirit of paying a debt, and act out of a sense of obligation to God because of God’s gifts to them. This represents a definite advance on the fear motivation, but love must be the dominant attitude behind one’s desire to give thanks, not just a sense of duty.

The phrase breaking bread in their homes recurs in verse 46. Although this expression can mean simply ‘sharing a meal’, it seems certain that on some occasions at least, they included in their common meals a re-enactment of the words and actions of Jesus at the Last Supper.

At this Passover feast, they re-enacted in a prayerful way a living memorial of an event that had happened in past history, but whose blessings they still experienced in the present. Their celebration took place in the setting of a sacred meal, during which they ate from a lamb which had been sacrificed to God in the temple the previous afternoon.

The connection between what Jesus said and did at the Last Supper and the sacrifice he made of himself the following afternoon was clear. After all, did he not speak of the bread as his body which was given for them, and of the wine as his blood which was poured out for them? The Eucharist was thus seen as the memorial of Jesus’ death. Paul said that eating the bread and drinking the cup were a proclamation of the Lord’s death. Earlier in the same letter (1 Corinthians 5:7) he had said our paschal lamb, Christ, has been sacrificed. The followers of Jesus thus came to see that Jesus offered himself as the new lamb of sacrifice, and commanded them to do this in memory of him.",

Moreover it is Catholic belief that this power continues to reside in the Church, and that part of the spiritual power of the Church gathered at Eucharist is to call on the Holy Spirit to change the gifts of bread and the wine (along with ourselves) into the Body and Blood of Christ.",

In the letter to the Hebrews (10:25), there is a warning against not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some. The Church follows this practice of requiring its members to worship together on Sunday as a community and to praise God for all the gifts that have flowed from the Son’s death and resurrection.",

This became the accepted pattern: bishops were the primary leaders of the official worship of the Christian community, and they appointed priests to assist them when their ‘flocks’ became too large for one man’s sacramental ministry. Today the Church carries on this ancient practice of having only bishops and the priests they appoint preside over the Eucharist. This is part of the doctrine of ‘apostolic succession’, which states that the bishops are the ones who succeed to the ministry and leadership of the apostles, to whom Jesus gave the direct commission: ‘Do this in memory of me’.",

When the reader has finished, the president in a discourse urges and invites us to the imitation of these noble things (homily). Then we all stand up together and offer prayers (intercessions). And when we have finished the prayer, bread is brought, and the wine and water, and the president similarly sends up prayers and thanksgivings to the best of his ability, and the congregation assents, saying Amen (Liturgy of the Eucharist); the distribution and reception of the consecrated elements by each one takes place (Communion) and they are sent to the absent by the deacons (Dismissal).

First, the Church teaches that Catholics who are conscious of serious sin (i.e. a grave matter) should refrain from receiving the Eucharist. Although no one is without sin and the Eucharist itself is a channel of God’s forgiveness, a person whose life is a contradiction of the gospel (i.e. in a state of mortal sin) may not receive the sacrament without first being reconciled through the sacrament of Penance, which we will consider in the next chapter. For lesser sins, the penitential act, if entered into in the spirit of conversion, serves to enable us to be ready.",

Catholics should earnestly wish to seek reconciliation with other Christians, both as Churches and individuals, so that we will be able to approach the altar of God together in genuine unity of mind and heart.

In the early Church, the letter of James tells us that this practice was continued: Are any among you sick? They should call for the elders of the church and have them pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord. The prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise them up; and anyone who has committed sins will be forgiven. (James 5:14-15)",

Prior to the renewal of the liturgy since the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), the emphasis was on preparation for death, and it was referred to as ‘Extreme Unction’ (the Last Anointing) or ‘The Last Rites’. However, the Council restored an emphasis on prayer for physical and spiritual healing for all seriously ill persons. The sacrament should not be deferred until the person is dangerously ill and on the point of death. Elderly people in a weak condition may be anointed, even though there is no question of any danger of death. The power of the sacrament to restore bodily as well as spiritual health is sufficient reason for its not being delayed. Moreover, there is no reason why a person may not receive this sacrament a number of times in the course of his or her lifetime, as often as it is judged to be called for. The sacrament of Anointing may also be celebrated as part of a Eucharistic celebration.",

If the celebration of Viaticum is not possible, there is also provision for Prayers for the Dying which are said as the seriously-ill person enters the final moments of life. In the case where a priest is called to a person who has already died, he will not administer the sacrament because sacraments can only be received by the living. In this case, the priest or deacon will offer prayers for God’s forgiveness and for the reception of the person into the kingdom of heaven.

Christians know that the Lord also freely shares his life and gives the Holy Spirit in other ways. Nevertheless, the Bible makes it clear that God chose to assume our human nature, and now chooses to communicate life and love through ordinary, natural signs: water, oil, bread and wine and simple human gestures and interactions. These signs, when properly enacted, become channels of God’s abundant love through the merits of Jesus Christ. He is the greatest sacrament of God’s saving love and the founder and life-source of all the sacraments.",

This is what we mean when we say that their salvation comes through their marriage. To be given care for each other’s spiritual welfare and final salvation is an awesome responsibility, but at the same time Christ provides them with the graces and helps they need to fulfil this responsibility. It is the vocation of the couple, their call from God, the state of life in which they are called to work out their salvation. (There are of course other particular vocations, such as the vocation to the single state. The importance of marriage should not prevent us from seeing the many different ways in which people are called to their Christian vocation.)",

Even accounting for the rise from its lowest point, the marriage rate is still not as high as it was in generations past. This demonstrates that the contemporary understanding of marriage and commitment is in a state of flux in our predominately secular society. In this social context, the Church’s teaching on marriage struggles to be heard and understood. Many couples now live together before making any formal commitment to one another.

Whenever ‘divorce’ has been part of a person’s history, Catholics who wish to re-marry in the Church must enter into a carefully regulated legal system through a regional marriage tribunal. This is also true for those who wish to be fully-initiated into the Catholic tradition and have been divorced and are, or seek to be, remarried.

His life was lived entirely in the service of others, and on several occasions he reminded his disciples that authority and leadership in his community had to be exercised in the same spirit and for the same purpose. At the Last Supper, as a final lesson to them, he performed the humble task of washing their feet and called on them to act in a similar fashion. Finally, Jesus crowned his life of service and self-sacrifice by allowing himself to be led to the cross and to death in obedience to his Father’s will and as a sacrifice for the sins of the world.",

The ‘laying on of hands’ was evidently an important element in setting people apart for special ministry. Thus in Acts chapter 6, the Twelve ask that seven men should be designated by the Jerusalem community to minister to the poor, so that they might themselves be free to preach the word of God. We are told that the community chose seven and set them before the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them (Acts 6:5-6). Later in Acts we find that along with the apostles, there was a group of ‘elders’ in the Jerusalem community. These are evidently local church leaders, and presumably they were designated by the apostles in the same way as the seven ministers.",

The only priests mentioned are Jewish priests and the word is never applied to the apostles, or to the elders – overseers. Jesus alone is designated as priest, our great high priest, and then only in one New Testament writing, the letter to the Hebrews. This suggests that the notion of priesthood was an idea which needed time to develop as Christians grew in self-understanding. This development no doubt paralleled their growing understanding of the Eucharist from messianic banquet, to memorial, to sacrificial meal. The disappearance of the Jewish priesthood after the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in 70 AD would have accelerated the understanding that Christians had their own sacrifice (the Eucharist) and needed a priesthood to offer it.",

What Trent intended to affirm was that the Eucharist and the priesthood are so essentially related to what Jesus did at the Last Supper, that in the theological sense they can be said to have been instituted there. The elements of the later Christian priesthood are to be found in Christ’s words and actions at the Last Supper, but it required time for this to be fully appreciated and understood.",

This means that Jesus’ priesthood is shared in a sense by all believers. All members of the Church have been called and chosen, and have the responsibility to carry on Christ’s mission. This responsibility comes in the first place through Baptism and is sealed by Confirmation. Through the Spirit, Christ shares his gifts with us, enabling us to carry out our mission. Paul elaborates on how the various gifts of the Spirit help us to live out our call to service (1 Corinthians 12:4-11). While there is a common mission which belongs to all members of the priestly people there is at the same time a variety of ministries, and among them are the ordained ministries of the deacon, the priest and the bishop.",

It is a law of the Church which could be changed if it were thought to be necessary or desirable, because celibacy is not an absolute requirement for priesthood. The Eastern rites of the Catholic Church allow married men to be ordained to the priesthood, a practice which reflects their culture and Christian tradition. There are particular circumstances where married men are ordained to priesthood. In such cases, these men had previously been ordained and served as ministers in other Christian traditions and have since been received into the Catholic Church. In recent times, special structures have been established within the Catholic Church to receive former Anglican clergy and lay people into full communion, while retaining dimensions of their Anglican disciplines and rituals.",

While there are good arguments in favour of a married priesthood, there is also no doubt that a celibate priest has the time and freedom to be available, mobile and committed to a degree that would be difficult for a responsible married man with a family (see 1 Corinthians 7:32-34). At the same time, we must acknowledge the commitment and dedication of married clergy throughout the Christian world. Certainly the requirement of celibacy should not be seen as a negative evaluation of the married state, and there seems little to be gained by discussing the relative merits of the two states, or the superiority of one over the other.",

Jesus himself was celibate, and both he and Paul taught that celibacy undertaken for the sake of the kingdom is an important gospel value. Both also make it clear that celibacy is not a call given to the majority, but that it is a gift that enables some followers of Christ to devote their individual attention to the affairs of the Lord and his kingdom. Since the early Church, men and women have committed themselves to God in this way. Celibacy is a sign or witness in that it involves renouncing some undeniably good things – sexual pleasure within marriage and the good of married life – for another good: greater freedom to devote time and attention to the Lord and to the building up of his body, the Church for the sake of the kingdom.",

However, the intention behind Jesus’ words is that no human being may be given the honour and respect due only to God the Father.

Subsequently the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith affirmed that this teaching was part of ‘the deposit of faith’. It described the Pope’s decision as a teaching that has been set forth infallibly by the ordinary and universal magisterium or teaching authority of the Church. Therefore, the Roman Catholic Church considers the discussion of ordaining women to the priesthood closed.",

These titles distinguish the different roles, orders or functions of these ministers. The important thing is that they all share in the one priesthood of Christ as ministers set apart for leadership and service in the Body of Christ. As we have said earlier, the Catholic understanding is that the bishops (a category which includes the Pope, archbishops and most cardinals) possess ‘the fullness of the sacrament of Orders’, while priests and deacons share in and extend the priestly ministry of their bishop. This understanding is based on the way ordained leadership actually evolved and functioned in the history of the Church, which Catholics believe was directed by the Holy Spirit.",

There is no denying that there is a scarcity of vocations to the ordained ministry: the Church does need more priests.",

Historical research has shown that the ancient Greek word was used in very specific circumstances and in relation to particular tasks. It was not a word that was applied generally to all acts of loving service. In other words, not everything was seen as ‘ministry’. However, ecumenical dialogues tend to highlight baptism as the basis for Christian ministry. In this context, every baptised person is understood to be, in some form, a ‘minister’.",

In this plan to save the world, they are given a special place and a unique intimacy with God. In turn, much will be demanded of them – they must be holy as God is holy.

Recognition of this truth distinguished Israel from the neighbouring pagan countries, which all worshipped a whole host of gods and goddesses. Along with this went the prohibition against attempting to make images of the Divine. Again the purpose was to acknowledge the truth of their God, and once again it distinguished them from their neighbours, all of whom fashioned and worshipped images of their national gods. So the commandment was primarily a condemnation of idolatry. The original form of the commandment was probably something like this: ‘I, the Lord, am your God. You shall have no other gods besides me’.",

They certainly did not consider them an oppressive burden, or the law of a God of wrath, but as an expression of the will of a God of love. Their observance of the Law was based not on fear, but on love and gratitude for the blessings they had received, and recognition of the wisdom of their God.",

The prayers of the Jewish people (especially the Psalms) clearly reflect this image of God. They display complete confidence in God as the one who saves. Emphasis on God’s readiness to forgive should not of course encourage the conclusion that God’s law is unimportant – far from it.

From the early centuries, the authority and leadership of the Roman Church was recognised by most of the Catholic world. When the church in Jerusalem died out at the end of the first century, the church of Rome began to take precedence. This was because it had been visited and taught by both Peter and Paul, and was the place of their martyrdom. From the second century onwards, it came to claim and receive a primacy over the other local churches, and was acknowledged as the centre of unity and the adjudicator of doctrinal and disciplinary disputes.

Docility is a willingness to be taught, a willingness to accept another’s judgement over one’s own when it is reasonable to do so. It calls for an open attitude towards the Church’s teaching, giving it a fair hearing, doing one’s best to appreciate the reasons in its favour, so as to leave oneself open to conviction about the truth and thus to be able to assent to it. A person without these attitudes can hardly be said to be acting in good conscience.",

They know that many of the most important movements within the Church have been initiated by the Spirit among priests or lay people, and only later have come to their attention. For this reason, they should engage in a continual dialogue with their people, and be open to the Spirit who often speaks through the gifts of others. Recent popes, conscious of their call from Christ to lead by means of service of the people, have revived the title, ‘the servant of the servants of God’.",

The ordinary religious people, who were predominantly poor, were those who waited on the Lord in a spirit of expectancy, in an attitude of spiritual childhood and humility, open to receiving whatever God had to offer. It was ideas such as these which laid the basis for the idea of the ‘faithful remnant’ of Israel, the ones who would experience God’s salvation. Faithfulness to the Lord meant waiting patiently for God’s coming in all humility and poverty. It was among these that messianic hope was strongest. Typical examples of this category at the time of Jesus were the pious and elderly Simeon and Anna, who are described in Luke’s Gospel as looking for the consolation and redemption of Israel (Luke 2:25-38). Mary must also be included among them, as seen by the outlook expressed by her in her ‘Magnificat’ (Luke 1:46-55).",

Realism however led to the recognition that those who would take up this struggle would be precisely those who had practical experience of what it meant to be poor. It was this experience which led many men and women in Israel to adopt an attitude of humble dependence on God, and of trust in God’s grace. This was not because they idealised poverty, or saw it as having any value of blessing in itself. But poverty did take on for them a definite religious significance; it called on them to open themselves to God, and prepared them to receive God’s gifts. Though their needs were often very worldly, the poor were still the ones most ready to receive the Messiah (Christ) into their homes and into their hearts.",

Jesus was introduced to the people by John the Baptist, whose own message of the need for repentance included the demand of charity to the poor, as a preparation for receiving the Messiah. In concrete terms, he demanded that people share their food and clothing with those who had none; that tax collectors must collect no more than their due; soldiers must rob no-one by violence or by false accusation (Luke 3:10-14). Later on, when John sent a delegation to ask Jesus if he was the one that was expected, Jesus answered in terms which confirmed John’s requirements: the blind receive their sight; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; the dead are raised up; and the poor have good news preached to them (Luke 7:22).",

But if their poverty and oppression did not immediately disappear, would not such declarations be destined to lead to disappointment and even despair? There must then be a further reason for his description of the poor as happy or blessed. However, we should not imagine that Jesus intended the poor to resign themselves to their condition, on the grounds that later, in the kingdom, the injustice would be rectified. The words of Jesus invite not resignation, but hope. The kingdom of God is something which broke into history in a new and decisive way in the ministry of Jesus. The elimination of the exploitation and poverty that prevents the poor from being fully human has begun, with the proclamation of a kingdom of justice that will put an end to their misery. Poverty is an evil, and therefore incompatible with the kingdom of God, which is intended to bring happiness to all those living in unhappiness and misfortune.

However, his message was extremely tough for those who placed their hopes in wealth. In Luke’s Gospel he implied that they were fools (Luke 12:16-21) since wealth cannot justify a person in God’s sight, especially when it is not accompanied by social responsibility. This latter point is made most effectively in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31). In the passage which comes just before this parable, Jesus spells out his own position in relation to wealth: No slave can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate the one and love the other, or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth (Luke 16:13).",

A powerful example of this is the story of the rich young man who approached Jesus wanting to become his disciple. When the young man found himself unable to accept the challenge to sell all he had and give the proceeds to the poor, Jesus commented to his disciples: How hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God (Mark 10:23).

The message Jesus left us is one of the need for care and concern for one another, and if necessary, to work to correct the wrongs and injustices done to others, and to change the structures responsible for them. Christian love demands this. There is no private way to God that ignores the needs of others. There can be no authentic acceptance of Jesus as one’s personal Lord and Saviour, if it is deaf to the cries of the poor. Concern for social justice is close to the heart of the gospel message.",

It is not easy to promote this kind of healthy humility or happy sobriety when we consider ourselves autonomous, when we exclude God from our lives or replace him with our own ego, and think that our subjective feelings can define what is right and what is wrong (224).",

We participate in this ‘judgement’ even now by the small and large choices we make in coming to be who we are. ‘Judgement’ is God revealing who we are.

Hell looks to the point at which there will be no more room for hatreds and violence ... It forbids any representation of God’s love as tolerance of evil or a compromise with it. Hell is where evil is contained, rendered impotent, and made to serve the higher purposes of a good creation ... Evil will be disclosed as a parasite living off the original good of creation.

Certainly we must not imagine Purgatory to be a kind of concentration camp or a temporary hell. It is blasphemous to think of God as demanding the last pound of flesh.",

      "content": "The word comes from a Latin term meaning purifying or cleansing. It seems preferable to think of purgatory not in terms of time or place or punishment, but in terms of a purifying process. It is the painful aspect of the passage from this life into God’s loving presence. At the moment of death, we are confronted with God and all the infinite love and holiness of God. In the light of this, many of us – if not all of us – will painfully and shamefully become aware of our weakness and sinfulness. In the light of God’s utter goodness, we can only acknowledge that which is darkness and sin within us. It is easy to imagine how at this passage from death to life, we will have to pass through the ‘purifying fire’ of God’s love.",

This is the Church’s teaching to the effect that there is an unbreakable bond between the Church on earth, the saints in heaven and those experiencing purgatory. Each year in the Church’s liturgical calendar, two successive days of celebration bring this truth home to us. On November 1st, we honour all the saints in heaven, not only canonised saints – those who have been officially declared by the Church to be with God because of their lives of evident holiness – but all who have gone before us to share God’s eternal happiness. They include those relatives and friends whom we have known and loved in this life.",

If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labour for me; and I do not know which I prefer. I am hard pressed between the two: my desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better; but to remain in the flesh is more necessary for you. (Philippians 1:21-24).",
