# ArchMin Courses - Long-Term SaaS Roadmap
**Platform Vision:** Free, white-labeled course management platform for churches and faith-based organizations

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-08
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## üéØ Vision & Business Model

### **Product Vision**
A free-forever, white-labeled course platform where churches and faith organizations can:
- Choose from ready-to-go programs (ACCF, CLI, etc.)
- Build their own custom programs and curriculum
- Manage students, cohorts, and content with minimal technical knowledge
- Have their branding dynamically applied across the entire platform

### **Target Customers**
- Churches running formation programs
- Dioceses/Archdioceses
- Catholic schools and retreat centers
- Faith-based educational organizations

### **Business Model**
- **Free forever** for all organizations
- Organizations apply and are invited to create accounts
- Minimal costs through Supabase free tier + efficient architecture
- Max expected: ~100 organizations

---

## üë• User Hierarchy & Roles

### **Platform Admin (You)**
- Creates and approves organizations
- Platform-level monitoring and support
- Can view all orgs (read-only for debugging)

### **Organization Owner (Org-Admin)**
- Initial sign-up user (tied to auth.uid)
- Creates and manages programs within their organization
- Can invite additional org admins
- Manages organization branding (logo, colors)
- Controls which programs are active

### **Program Admin**
- Manages specific program(s) within the organization
- Creates cohorts, modules, and materials
- Enrolls students and assigns coordinators
- Marks reflections and tracks attendance
- Can be assigned by org-admin

### **Hub/Group Coordinator**
- Manages local hub/group within a cohort
- Marks attendance for their group
- Views their group members' progress
- Optional role (not all programs use hubs)

### **Participant (Student)**
- Enrolled in one or more cohorts
- Views materials, submits reflections
- Participates in cohort messaging
- Sees branding of the program they're enrolled in

---

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### **Multi-Tenancy Strategy**
- **Row-level security (RLS)** in single Supabase database
- All organizations share one database with strict RLS policies
- Expected scale: ~100 orgs (well within Supabase free tier limits)
- Data isolation via `organization_id` foreign keys

### **Subdomain Architecture**
- **Primary domain:** `archmin.courses` (or similar)
- **Org subdomains:** `{org-slug}.archmin.courses`
  - Example: `stlouis.archmin.courses`
  - Example: `holyspirit.archmin.courses`
- **Vercel wildcard domain setup** (requires nameserver method)
- Dynamic routing: `/[org_slug]/courses/[program_slug]/...`

### **White-Labeling Strategy**
- Minimal "ArchMin Courses" platform branding
- On login, system pulls enrolled program's branding from DB
- CSS variables dynamically applied per program
- Logo, colors, fonts all configurable per program
- User never sees "ArchMin" once logged in‚Äîonly program branding

### **Database Schema Additions**

#### New: `organizations` table
```sql
CREATE TABLE organizations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  slug TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,  -- Used in subdomain
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,

  -- Ownership
  owner_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),

  -- Branding (org-level, can be overridden by programs)
  logo_url TEXT,
  primary_color TEXT DEFAULT '#334642',

  -- Status
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'active', 'suspended')),
  approved_by UUID REFERENCES user_profiles(id),
  approved_at TIMESTAMPTZ,

  -- Metadata
  contact_email TEXT,
  website TEXT,

  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_organizations_slug ON organizations(slug);
CREATE INDEX idx_organizations_owner ON organizations(owner_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_organizations_status ON organizations(status);

COMMENT ON TABLE organizations IS 'Churches and organizations that run programs';
COMMENT ON COLUMN organizations.slug IS 'Used for subdomain: {slug}.archmin.courses';
```

#### Modified: `programs` table
```sql
ALTER TABLE programs
  ADD COLUMN organization_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

CREATE INDEX idx_programs_organization ON programs(organization_id);

COMMENT ON COLUMN programs.organization_id IS 'Organization that owns this program';
```

#### New: `organization_admins` table
```sql
CREATE TABLE organization_admins (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  organization_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_profile_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES user_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role TEXT DEFAULT 'admin' CHECK (role IN ('owner', 'admin')),
  invited_by UUID REFERENCES user_profiles(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),

  UNIQUE(organization_id, user_profile_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_org_admins_org ON organization_admins(organization_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_org_admins_user ON organization_admins(user_profile_id);
```

---

## üì± Mobile App Strategy

### **Problem**
- SvelteKit app can't be deployed directly to iOS/Android app stores
- Admin interface too complex for mobile anyway

### **Solution: Separate Mobile App**
Build a **lightweight React Native or Flutter app** for student-facing features only:

#### **Mobile App Scope (Student-Focused)**
- ‚úÖ View course materials (videos, documents, resources)
- ‚úÖ Submit reflections
- ‚úÖ Cohort messaging (instant messaging like FB Messenger)
- ‚úÖ View progress and grades
- ‚úÖ Push notifications for deadlines and messages
- ‚ùå No admin controls (use web for admin tasks)

#### **Technology Options**

**Option 1: React Native (Expo)**
- **Pros:** JavaScript (familiar), Expo Go for easy testing, large ecosystem
- **Cons:** Slightly larger app size
- **Cost:** Free (self-hosted)

**Option 2: Flutter**
- **Pros:** Single codebase, excellent performance, smaller app size
- **Cons:** Dart language (new learning curve)
- **Cost:** Free (self-hosted)

**Recommendation:** **React Native with Expo** for faster development and JavaScript consistency

#### **Mobile App Architecture**
- Same Supabase database (shared with web app)
- Same RLS policies for security
- Auth via Supabase Auth (SSO with web)
- Realtime messaging via Supabase Realtime
- Program branding pulled from database (same as web)

---

## üí¨ Messaging System

### **Requirements**
- Instant messaging (like Facebook Messenger)
- Cohort-level group chats
- Direct messages between students and admins (future)
- Real-time delivery
- **Ultra-low cost** (free tier preferred)

### **Solution: Supabase Realtime**

#### **Why Supabase Realtime?**
- ‚úÖ **Already using Supabase** (no new dependencies)
- ‚úÖ **Free tier:** 2 projects, 500 concurrent connections, 2GB bandwidth/month
- ‚úÖ **Pricing beyond free:** $2.50 per 1M messages (extremely cheap)
- ‚úÖ **Built-in auth integration**
- ‚úÖ **RLS support** for secure messaging
- ‚úÖ **Works on web and mobile** (React Native SDK available)

#### **Alternative Considered: Separate Chat Service**
- Firebase: More expensive, vendor lock-in
- Appwrite: Requires separate hosting
- Stream Chat: Not free, $99/month minimum
- **Verdict:** Supabase Realtime is best fit for budget

#### **Messaging Schema**

```sql
CREATE TABLE chat_rooms (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  cohort_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES cohorts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,  -- "Feb 2025 Foundations Chat"
  type TEXT DEFAULT 'cohort' CHECK (type IN ('cohort', 'direct', 'hub')),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE TABLE chat_messages (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  room_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES chat_rooms(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  sender_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES user_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  message_text TEXT NOT NULL,
  sent_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  edited_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

CREATE TABLE chat_room_members (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  room_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES chat_rooms(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_profile_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES user_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  last_read_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  joined_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),

  UNIQUE(room_id, user_profile_id)
);

-- RLS Policies
ALTER TABLE chat_messages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view messages in their rooms"
  ON chat_messages FOR SELECT
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM chat_room_members
      WHERE room_id = chat_messages.room_id
        AND user_profile_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can send messages in their rooms"
  ON chat_messages FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM chat_room_members
      WHERE room_id = chat_messages.room_id
        AND user_profile_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

#### **Realtime Subscription (Client)**
```typescript
// Subscribe to cohort chat room
const subscription = supabase
  .channel(`chat:${roomId}`)
  .on('postgres_changes',
    {
      event: 'INSERT',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'chat_messages',
      filter: `room_id=eq.${roomId}`
    },
    (payload) => {
      // New message received, update UI
      appendMessage(payload.new);
    }
  )
  .subscribe();
```
