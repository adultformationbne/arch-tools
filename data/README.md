## Regenerating Data

To regenerate the calendar after making changes to source data:

```bash
# Generate new calendar
python3 scripts/generate_liturgical_calendar_v2.py

# Validate against authoritative sources
python3 scripts/validate_against_authoritative.py

# Import to database (if needed)
# Use Supabase dashboard or migration scripts
```

## Database Integration

The generated CSV files are imported into Supabase tables:
- `liturgical_calendar`: Daily calendar entries (from `liturgical_calendar_full.csv`)
- `lectionary_readings`: All readings (from `Lectionary.csv`)
- `liturgical_years`: Year cycles (from `LitugricalYears.csv`)

See `supabase/migrations/` for import scripts.

## Notes

- **All Fixed Feasts** use their proper feast readings (not ferial)
- **All Solemnities** always override ferial readings
- **Ferial readings** are fallback only for days without specific celebrations
- **Australian calendar** follows local episcopal conference decisions
