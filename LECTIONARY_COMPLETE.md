## Usage Examples

### Get Readings for Any Date

```sql
-- Simple query using helper function
SELECT * FROM get_readings_for_date('2025-01-19');

-- Returns:
-- calendar_date: 2025-01-19
-- liturgical_name: Second Sunday in Ordinary Time
-- liturgical_season: Ordinary Time
-- liturgical_week: 2
-- cycle: A
-- first_reading: Isaiah 49:3, 5-6
-- psalm: Psalm 39:2, 4, 7-10
-- second_reading: 1 Corinthians 1:1-3
-- gospel_reading: John 1:29-34
```

### Manual Join Query

```sql
-- For DGR system - get readings for a specific date
SELECT
  lc.calendar_date,
  lc.liturgical_name,
  lc.liturgical_season,
  ly.sunday_cycle,
  lr.gospel_reading,
  lr.first_reading,
  lr.psalm,
  lr.second_reading
FROM liturgical_calendar lc
JOIN liturgical_years ly ON ly.year = lc.year
LEFT JOIN lectionary_readings lr ON (
  -- Sunday readings
  (lc.day_of_week = 'Sunday'
   AND lr.year_cycle = ly.sunday_cycle
   AND lr.week_number = lc.liturgical_week::TEXT
   AND lr.day_type = 'Sunday'
   AND lr.time_period = 'Ordinary')
  OR
  -- Weekday readings
  (lc.day_of_week != 'Sunday'
   AND lr.year_cycle = ly.weekday_cycle::TEXT
   AND lr.week_number = lc.liturgical_week::TEXT
   AND lr.day_type = lc.day_of_week
   AND lr.time_period = 'Ordinary')
)
WHERE lc.calendar_date = '2025-01-20';
```

### Get Next 90 Days of Readings

```sql
SELECT
  lc.calendar_date,
  lc.liturgical_name,
  lr.gospel_reading
FROM liturgical_calendar lc
LEFT JOIN liturgical_years ly ON ly.year = lc.year
LEFT JOIN lectionary_readings lr ON (
  (lc.day_of_week = 'Sunday' AND lr.year_cycle = ly.sunday_cycle AND lr.day_type = 'Sunday')
  OR
  (lc.day_of_week != 'Sunday' AND lr.year_cycle = ly.weekday_cycle::TEXT)
)
WHERE lc.calendar_date BETWEEN CURRENT_DATE AND CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '90 days'
ORDER BY lc.calendar_date;
```

## Key Dates Calculated

For each year (2025-2030), the system knows:

**Moveable Dates:**
- Easter Sunday (calculated via Computus)
- Ash Wednesday (46 days before Easter)
- Palm Sunday (7 days before Easter)
- Holy Thursday, Good Friday, Holy Saturday
- Pentecost (49 days after Easter)
- Trinity Sunday (56 days after Easter / 1st Sunday after Pentecost)

- Ordinary Time Part 1 (Baptism - Ash Wednesday)
- Lent (Ash Wednesday - Holy Saturday)
- Easter (Easter Sunday - Pentecost)
- Ordinary Time Part 2 (After Pentecost - Advent)

---

## Integration with DGR System

### Option 1: Direct Query in Schedule Form

```sql
-- When assigning a date, show the liturgical info and readings
SELECT
  lc.liturgical_name,
  lr.gospel_reading,
  CONCAT_WS('; ', lr.first_reading, lr.psalm, lr.second_reading, lr.gospel_reading) as all_readings
FROM liturgical_calendar lc
LEFT JOIN liturgical_years ly ON ly.year = lc.year
LEFT JOIN lectionary_readings lr ON ...
WHERE lc.calendar_date = $1;
```

### Option 2: Pre-populate DGR Schedule

```sql
-- Populate dgr_schedule with liturgical data for next year
INSERT INTO dgr_schedule (date, liturgical_date, readings_data, gospel_reference)
SELECT
  lc.calendar_date,
  lc.liturgical_name,
  jsonb_build_object(
    'first_reading', lr.first_reading,
    'psalm', lr.psalm,
    'second_reading', lr.second_reading,
    'gospel', lr.gospel_reading
  ),
  lr.gospel_reading
FROM liturgical_calendar lc
JOIN liturgical_years ly ON ly.year = lc.year
LEFT JOIN lectionary_readings lr ON ...
WHERE lc.calendar_date BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-12-31'
ON CONFLICT (date) DO UPDATE SET
  liturgical_date = EXCLUDED.liturgical_date,
  readings_data = EXCLUDED.readings_data,
  gospel_reference = EXCLUDED.gospel_reference;
```

## Future Maintenance

### To Add More Years (e.g., 2031-2035):

1. **Edit and run:**
   ```bash
   # Edit scripts/generate_liturgical_calendar.py
   # Change: for year in range(2025, 2031):
   # To:     for year in range(2025, 2036):

   python3 scripts/generate_liturgical_calendar.py
   python3 scripts/import_liturgical_calendar.py
   ```

2. **Add to liturgical_years table:**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO liturgical_years (year, sunday_cycle, weekday_cycle)
   VALUES
     (2031, 'A', 'II'),
     (2032, 'B', 'I'),
     -- etc.
   ```

### The Easter algorithm works until year 4099!
