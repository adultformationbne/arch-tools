In these works, faith in a divine being is dismissed as infantile, divisive and destructive. For Dawkins, Hitchens and other publicly-avowed atheists, only the rational and scientifically discernible world is credible. Any statement of faith beyond this is a delusion. Dawkins, Hitchens and companions are best understood as social iconoclasts attempting to shatter what they see as illusions and shadows opposed to human reason.
