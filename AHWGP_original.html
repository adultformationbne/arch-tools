It has now been revised and adapted to best meet those needs in changing times.

		<div id="_idContainer016" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
			<p><span class="CharOverride-17">Who is Jesus Christ? How can his life help me to lead mine?</span></p>
			<p><span class="CharOverride-17">What is the Bible? Why do Catholics do the things they do?</span></p>
		</div>
		<div id="_idContainer017" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
			<p class="_1-Intro-tab-head"><span class="CharOverride-18">Are you interested in Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church? </span></p>
			<p class="_1-Intro-body">This book explores both the life of Jesus, who lived and breathed as a person just like us, and the tradition which continues in his name. Jesus, sent by God the Father to save us, offers the world hope through his life, death and resurrection. Jesus remains a living presence among us through the Holy Spirit and empowers us for Christian discipleship.</p>
			<p class="_1-Intro-body">Through these pages you will uncover how the early Christian community grew and responded to the problems and issues of the world. Today the Catholic Church provides a community of faith for its members to worship God and equips them for Christian mission in the world.</p>
			<p class="_1-Intro-tab-head"><span class="CharOverride-18">Do you want a deeper understanding of your faith? </span></p>
			<p class="_1-Intro-body"><span class="syb-med-it">At Home with God’s People </span>presents a concise overview of the teachings of the Catholic Church. The material provides an excellent resource for personal reflection, reading and praying. It may be used in a variety of ways to assist you to: deepen your understanding of your faith; grow in your relationship with God; and be informed and transformed for ministry and mission. </p>
			<p class="_1-Intro-body">It may also be the foundation for a small group study program. A group could plan to work through topics appropriate to their specific learning needs, e.g. a sacramental preparation team might focus on the topics relating to sacraments. Be aware of the limits and demands on the participants’ time – plan for a five session program with the option of negotiating the next ‘program’ at the last meeting.</p>
			<p class="_1-Intro-body">For the group leader a book such as <span class="syb-med-it">Facilitating for Growth</span> by Barbara Fleischer (Liturgical Press) is an excellent guide to equip leaders for their role. Effective leadership enables a group to come <span class="syb-med-it">together to help one another integrate the Christian story and its vision with their own stories and ideals</span> (p22). </p>
			<p class="_1-Intro-tab-head"><span class="CharOverride-18">Are you a catechumen in the RCIA?</span></p>
			<p class="_1-Intro-body">This resource may be of assistance to you in the Period of the Catechumenate of the <span class="syb-med-it">Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults </span>(para 75-80) . It is important to remember however that this is only one resource for this phase of your faith journey. This resource is <span class="CharOverride-19">not</span> the ‘program to become a Catholic’! There is much wisdom in an old adage: ‘faith is caught, not taught’. Central to your journey during this period is your active participation in the local worshipping community and reflection on the Sunday scriptures.</p>
			<p class="_1-Intro-body">The Catechumenate is sometimes seen as an ‘apprenticeship’ into the Christian life during which you will: <span class="syb-med-it">learn to turn more readily to God in prayer; to bear witness to the faith ... to keep </span>[your] <span class="syb-med-it">hopes set on Christ … and to practise love of neighbour </span>(RCIA no 75 adapted). One objective of this period is to provide you with <span class="syb-med-it">an appropriate acquaintance … </span>with the precepts and teachings of the Catholic Church (RCIA no 75). <span class="syb-med-it">At Home with God’s People </span>is one means, or tool, to do that. While the topics in the book are presented in a logical order, please do not feel restricted by this sequence. If a topic is of interest to you, or addresses a specific question or need you have, then go to that section of the book.</p>
			<p class="_1-Intro-tab-head"><span class="CharOverride-18">Are you a catechist?</span></p>
			<p class="_1-Intro-body">This book provides useful reference material on the teachings of the Catholic Church. To supplement this book please visit the <span class="syb-med-it">At Home with God’s People</span> website: www.ahwgp.com. The site provides useful background material (‘Resources’ tab) for the topics in the book, e.g. websites and further reading. The site also contains an outline of a ‘Catechist role description’ for this very significant phase on the journey of faith. </p>
			<p class="_1-Intro-body">However the best guide is the <span class="syb-med-it">Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults</span>. In Australia the Rites have been published by St Paul’s Publications and are available in hardback and a study edition. Paragraphs 75-80 cover the Period of the Catechumenate (the period when <span class="syb-med-it">At Home with God’s People</span> may be a useful resource). Paragraph 78 is very pertinent to your role: <span class="syb-med-it">The instruction that the catechumens receive during this period should be of a kind that while presenting Catholic teaching in its entirety also enlightens faith, directs the heart toward God, fosters participation in the liturgy, inspires apostolic activity, and nurtures a life completely in accord with the spirit of Christ.</span> </p>
			<p class="_1-Intro-body"><span class="syb-med-it">At Home with God’s People </span>provides participants with suggested questions for reflection and discussion. While these may be helpful in the early stages of the group to generate sharing, they are no substitute for the catechumens’ own questions, enquiries and concerns. </p>
			<p class="_1-Intro-body">One of your key roles in the group is to be a facilitator – one who ‘makes easy’ the work of the group. As a facilitator you will always be adapting the content and process to suit the needs and requirements of the participants. There is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach. </p>
			<p class="_1-Intro-body">The primary purpose of the Period of the Catechumenate is formation in the Christian life, not information about Christianity. Use whatever resources are appropriate and available. Check out if your parish or diocese has audio-visual resources you can borrow. Inform the catechumens about any adult faith education presentations in the parish or diocese that may be helpful for their on-going faith formation. Encourage participants to experience various aspects of the mission and social action of the parish, e.g. Care and Concern group, St Vincent de Paul Society, Social Justice group.    </p>
			<p class="_1-Intro-tab-head"><span class="CharOverride-18">Are you a member of the parish RCIA team?</span></p>
			<p class="_1-Intro-body">The analogy of a railway may be helpful. It is tempting to think of the role of the RCIA team as the ‘Controller’ – efficiently directing traffic, making sure timetables are printed, ensuring trains run on time and that platforms are tidy. However this is to deny the truth that we are in fact a pilgrim church and we take the ‘conversion journey’ together. Perhaps a better analogy is that of the ‘Conductor’. He or she makes the same trip as the passengers and shares with them the same steep climbs, deep gorges, long tunnels and glorious vistas. </p>
			<p class="_1-Intro-body">With open hands and hearts the team – along with catechists, sponsors and the whole parish community – approach this Period of the Catechumenate not with a ‘subject’ to be transmitted, but with a deep humility and openness to the encounter of mutual conversion. </p>
			<p class="_1-Intro-body">As ‘Conductor’ we allow ourselves to be a channel for God’s grace, transforming love, peace and reconciliation. Paragraph 1 of the <span class="syb-med-it">Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults</span> outlines a vision that, <span class="syb-med-it">after hearing the mystery of Christ proclaimed, </span>Catechumens <span class="syb-med-it">seek the living God and enter the way of faith and conversion as the Holy Spirit opens their heart.</span></p>
			<p class="_1-Intro-body">As members of the team it is essential that you are clear about vision, purpose, intention and process. The <span class="syb-med-it">Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults</span> is your ‘guidebook’. For example when you are clear about the purpose of each period of the Catechumenate it will be obvious that a catechesis resource such as <span class="syb-med-it">At Home with God’s People </span>will not be appropriate for Lent or Mystagogia. </p>
			<p class="_1-Intro-body">Books such as <span class="syb-med-it">The RCIA Team Book</span> (Evangelisation Brisbane) can be beneficial resources to provide practical information about specific roles, pastoral principles, planning outlines and practical strategies for each period of the Catechumenate.</p>
			<p class="_1-Intro-body">The <span class="syb-med-it">Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults</span> is intended for those who are unbaptised. Part II of the <span class="syb-med-it">Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults </span>provides pastoral guidelines for those people already baptised who express interest in becoming Catholic. Paragraph 391 directs that: <span class="syb-med-it">The baptised Christian is to receive both doctrinal and spiritual preparation, adapted to individual pastoral requirements, for reception into the full communion of the Catholic Church</span>. </p>
			<p class="_1-Intro-body">The key phrase here is ‘adapted to individual pastoral requirements’. For example a candidate who has been a regular church-goer may already be very familiar with the Creed and the Bible. In a situation such as this the team, with the catechist, and in dialogue with the candidate, would determine a process of formation that respects the candidate’s journey of faith and current needs. In this way, <span class="syb-med-it">The rite is arranged so that no greater burden than necessary (see Acts 15:28) is required for the establishment of communion and unity</span> (387).</p>

But God is also the starting point, because faith itself is a gift of God. So too, the restlessness which leads a man or woman to take the first steps towards faith, or to reinforce the initial faith which has already been given, is also God’s gift. From whatever perspective we view things it is God who is both the source and the goal of all our searching and striving.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In the world today there are many professed believers in God who are not Christian. Believers include Jews, Muslims, Hindus and many who would disclaim any affiliation with any particular religious movement.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">And in fact, it is possible to come to belief in God, and arrive at some knowledge of God, just by using our natural intelligence, our own natural powers of reasoning. (We believe, of course, that even human intelligence is a divine gift.)</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The evidence around us</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">There is the evidence of the beauty and order and harmony of the world around us: the greatness of the universe, of which our planet earth is relatively such a tiny part; the power of the sun, the beauty of the moon, the magnificence of a star-studded sky on a clear night, the beauty of a beach in the moonlight; the regular ebb and flow of the tide, the surge of a rolling surf; the constant pattern by which the seasons follow one upon the other, the way night follows day; the variety and colour of the trees and flowers; the existence of so many species of animals, birds and fish; and especially, the wonder of human life.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">So many young couples have looked into the eyes of their new-born first child, and thought: how can anyone not believe that there is a God? There are, then, many strong reasons which appeal to our human minds and hearts, to argue that there must be some supreme intelligence behind it all.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The only alternative is that all this wonderfully creative work happened by chance. The story is told of two scientists who were admiring a perfectly constructed model of the whole solar system. One asked the other: ‘Who made it?’ The other, knowing that his colleague was a professed non-believer, replied: ‘Nobody made it. It just happened.’ The former did not appreciate being made fun of, and said as much. To which the believer responded: ‘If you cannot accept that this model happened by chance, how can you accept that no intelligent being was responsible for the real thing?’</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">An alternative: atheism</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">A believer will argue that it is much easier to believe in God than not. The Bible has harsh words for non-believers. The Psalmist states </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Fools say in their hearts, ‘There is no God’</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Psalm 14:1). And Paul, writing to the Romans, says that the pagans are without excuse for failing to recognise the existence of a Creator from the wonderful things which God has made. </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Ever since the creation of the world his eternal power and divine nature, invisible though they are, have been understood and seen through the things he has made. So they are without excuse …</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Romans 1:20).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">One might well ask how many real atheists there are in the world. Certainly there are many practical atheists, that is, people who choose to live as though God does not exist, who prefer not to think about it. There are also many who would sincerely classify themselves as agnostics – people who suspend belief because they are unable to decide one way or the other from the apparently conflicting evidence which they find confronting them. It must also be said that doubt is distinct from a denial of faith. As some of the great mystics and spiritual writers throughout history have expressed, doubt is a companion of faith. It can be the doorway that leads to a deeper faith.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">But how numerous are the convinced theoretical atheists? In recent years, some prominent atheists have become increasingly vocal. Publications such as Richard Dawkins’ </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">The God Delusion</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (2006) and Christopher Hitchens’ </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (2007) have presented a public challenge to religious faith. In these works, faith in a divine being is dismissed as infantile, divisive and destructive. For Dawkins, Hitchens and other publicly-avowed atheists, only the rational and scientifically discernible world is credible. Any statement of faith beyond this is a delusion. Dawkins, Hitchens and companions are best understood as social iconoclasts attempting to shatter what they see as illusions and shadows opposed to human reason. Rather than exorcising religion from the public realm, these debates have only served to keep religious faith on centre stage. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">These arguments against faith are not new. In the second century, a writer called Celsus argued that Christianity was full of ‘fairy tales’ and childish beliefs. Perhaps what is new is the sense of militantism associated with this ‘new atheism’. In some parts of the world, an advertising campaign was undertaken with signs on public transport saying, ‘Relax. There is no God. Go ahead and enjoy yourself.’ One Christian thinker suggested that the Christian churches should respond with a similar sign: ‘Relax. There is a God. Go ahead and enjoy yourself.’ </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Fundamentalist beliefs, whether theistic or atheistic, are destructive. What these latest arguments against faith fail to take into account is the significant intellectual tradition which has accompanied the search for faith and God. Faith and reason go hand in hand. Our Catholic tradition holds that there is a discernible Presence which, in part, can be discovered through a reasoned exploration of the world and the human person. Faith and reason are not enemies but necessary companions. Science and religion are partners in the search for truth. </span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading ParaOverride-17">The problem of evil</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Admittedly there are problems about the argument for the existence of God from the beauty of creation, and the order and harmony in nature. For not all creation is beautiful and harmonious. There is also an ugliness and a wildness and a savagery in nature – earthquakes, famines, drought, floods, storms and tempests. There is also all too often an ugliness in the affairs of human beings, in the way they treat one another – wars, persecutions, racism, and various other forms of injustice, exploitation and oppression.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Therefore the question which inevitably arises is this: if there exists a God who is good and loving and merciful, how could such a God permit evil and injustice and suffering? How can we reconcile the existence of a good and loving and merciful God with the evil and injustice and suffering that are so much a part of a world created by God?</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In one area of human tragedies, the question is not so difficult to answer. The plain fact is that most of the evil is man-made. It is the tragic result of our abuse of that freedom which is one of God’s greatest gifts to us. For God to prevent such evil would necessitate the withdrawal of that gift of freedom, and this would in effect mean taking away our human nature.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In creating us as intelligent, free beings, God knew that we would abuse our intelligence and freedom, and this is what has constantly been the case throughout the whole history of the human race. We cannot therefore hold God responsible for all the evil in the world, the evil which is the result of human sin.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Acts of God</span></p>
			<p class="body-first-par-no-tab"><span class="CharOverride-18">But the problem is not so easy to answer in the case of the misery and suffering caused by phenomena which are not made by humans, such as earthquakes, floods, droughts and other natural disasters – what are popularly called ‘acts of God’.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">People often become bewildered and angry when confronted with tragedies for which there seems no natural explanation or moral justification. At such times, there is the natural tendency to blame God for apparent cruelty or lack of concern. We find this reaction often expressed in the pages of the Bible, especially the Old Testament. The Book of Job is the fullest biblical treatment of the problem of suffering. It is the story of an innocent man who gradually loses everything. Chapters 39 to 42 of this book give us a powerful presentation of this problem. Although he does not understand, Job grows into a peaceful acceptance and serenity, so that in spite of his misfortune he can still say</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18"> Blessed be the name of the Lord.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Several of the Psalms too depict the innocent righteous sufferer complaining to God about the misfortune that afflicts him and the people of Israel as a whole. But again these prayers always end with an expression of trust and confidence in the goodness and wise providence of God.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Like Job and the psalmists, we have to humbly acknowledge that there are mysteries in the world which our finite minds are unable to comprehend. Our human horizons are limited, and we can see only a restricted area of the total reality. The infinite mind of God sees the whole picture, while we can see only a tiny piece of the canvas. How particular disasters and tragedies fit into God’s overall plan we often cannot hope to grasp.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The experience of Jesus</span></p>
			<p class="body-first-par-no-tab"><span class="CharOverride-18">To appeal to the experience of Jesus at this point is to anticipate a little, but it needs to be said here that the Christian is in a much better position to understand and to accept the problem of suffering in the world. Jesus renounced a life of comfort and security, but instead </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">emptied himself, taking the form of a slave</span><span class="CharOverride-18">, and </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death – even death on a cross</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Philippians 2:7-8). He freely </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Matthew 20:28).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">As with Job and the psalmist, there was the natural human reaction on Jesus’ part, too, to the suffering that his mission involved. He prayed to his Father on the night before his death:</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18"> for you all things are possible; remove this cup from me</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Mark 14:36). In the midst of his suffering on the cross, he cried out in anguish: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Mark 15:34). But even in his agony of fear he signified his acceptance of God’s will (Mark 14:36), and among his last words on the cross was a prayer that expressed his serenity: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Father, into your hands I commend my spirit </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Luke 23:46).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Christian can find in Jesus a companion in the midst of the most severe sufferings, for his cross was very much a part of our suffering world. The author of the letter to the Hebrews emphasises the identification of Jesus with us when he refers to him as one who is able</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18"> to sympathise with our weaknesses</span><span class="CharOverride-18">, because </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">we have one who in every respect has been tested as we are, yet without sin</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (4:15); moreover, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">he learned obedience through what he suffered </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(5:8). The suffering of Jesus was life-giving and productive of great good for humanity. By reflecting on his experience, we can begin to see that suffering can have a rich and positive value.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Although there are mysteries we cannot hope to fathom in this life, and questions we cannot answer, we need to look at all the evidence – good as well as evil, joy as well as suffering. The human mind can discover God’s goodness in the beauty of the world created for our benefit and enjoyment, and in God’s gifts of life and love. Suffering is only part of the human experience, but even the pain, suffering and evil that are part of the fabric of our lives can speak to us of God. There is a strange mixture of joy and sadness in our experience, in which we can sometimes glimpse a life-giving pattern. At times, suffering is a prelude to real happiness. Overall, the problems and difficulties associated with human existence are not enough to outweigh all the evidence for the existence of a good and loving God.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">Images of God</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Throughout human history people have formed different images of God. God has not always been seen as a personal being, but sometimes as one or other of the impersonal forces of nature. People have worshipped the sun, thunder and lightning as their gods. They have fashioned for themselves their own gods, idols of gold and silver and bronze which they have worshipped. At times in history, they have imagined the existence of a whole host of gods, often in conflict with one another. And still today, there are those who can go no further than speak of some higher power.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Even when people came to the point of believing in a personal god or gods, their ideas were many and varied. Sometimes they conceived their gods as angry, vindictive masters, whom they felt they had to placate and appease by the offering of sacrifices, even human sacrifices. At other times they thought of the gods as superior beings who regarded humans as mere playthings to have sport with, gods who acted capriciously and according to their whims.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Only rarely could they conceive of a god or gods who were really interested or cared about the welfare of mere individual mortals. This is true of some ‘believers’ in God today. They see God as a kind of divine watchmaker, who set the world in motion in the beginning but now sits idly by; just letting things take their course (this way of understanding God is called ‘Deism’). We can imagine this picture of a god sitting in the grandstand, watching the game of human history unfold, but taking no active part or even any active interest in the affairs and foibles of people. Could there be any more monstrous conception than this, of a do-nothing, detached god? Surely it would be more logical to deny the existence of any higher power, than to accept the existence of such a deity.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The one true God</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Into this confused variety of beliefs about gods in ancient times came a religion which stood out like a beacon of light in the darkness, the religion of the people of Israel, the religion of that people with whom we share that part of the Bible we call the Old Testament.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Here we find a concept of God that far surpassed any other in the world of that time. The Jews believed, and Christians share this belief, that God’s self-revelation to them was as one God only, a personal God, a God who asked to be identified as </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">I am who I am</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Exodus 3:14), a God who loved them and wanted to be loved by them in return. A God who chose them:</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18"> you shall be my people, and I will be your God </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Ezekiel 36:28). God wanted their love and obedience and service, but also their happiness and prosperity.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In a later chapter, we shall be taking a closer look at the Bible, the word of God. As we become more familiar with the Scriptures, we will come to appreciate more the depth and tenderness of God’s love for us – God’s own people. God’s relationship is sometimes described in terms of a relationship between father and son, at other times, between bridegroom and bride. Without this revelation on God’s part, we could never have come to know the extent of God’s love for us.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Christian insight</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">But in the Christian view, even this lofty teaching of the Old Testament was only a pale shadow of what was to come, when God the Father would choose to send his own Son into the world as a human being, as one of us:</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18"> the Word became flesh</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">and lived among us </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(John 1:14). By seeing the works and hearing the words of the man Jesus, we gain an insight into the character of God that was otherwise unknown and unknowable – God’s love, compassion and mercy, God’s care and concern for individuals, especially the poor, the sick, the weak, the outcasts, those whom Jesus called God’s ‘little ones’.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">By our own reasoning and intellectual capabilities, we can know something of the power and love and goodness of God. By getting to know Jesus Christ, we experience God’s love and mercy in a way we otherwise would never even suspect. His whole life was the love of God in action. As we look at the cross of Christ, we see God’s love revealed in all its clarity.</span></p>

If two people have to be commanded to talk to each other, their relationship obviously does not have a lot going for it. Besides, it will not work. Perhaps two people can be made to speak words to each other, but they cannot be made to communicate. This happens only when they want to share something with each other. Communication is one of the expressions of love. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">When Jesus talked about prayer he revealed to us its unsuspected depths, and he spoke about God’s side of the communication.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The first thing we should note about prayer is that it is a gift. It is God who speaks first. Prayer is not something we do in order to get in touch with God, but rather it is God’s gift to us. We cannot pray unless God opens our minds and moves our hearts and attracts us to God’s own self.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">That may come as a surprise to many people and may even be somewhat deflating to hear. We tend to think of prayer as our business, our activity. Yet on reflection, we will come to see it as an encouraging truth and even a great relief. We are indeed responsible adults who must make it through each day, and yet we are also God’s children, walking along hand in hand with God, in total and peaceful dependence.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Paul teaches this truth with his usual bluntness: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but that very Spirit intercedes with sighs too deep for words. And God, who searches the heart, knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Romans 8:26-27). In other words, prayer is what the Spirit of God produces in us, and God knows the mind of the Spirit – and what is in our minds, and what are our needs.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus taught us</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The best model of prayer we have is Jesus himself. The writer of the Letter to the Hebrews reflects on Jesus’ life of prayer: In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered; and having been made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him (5:7-9). </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">We are told that at the beginning of his ministry, the Spirit drove him into the desert to enter into deep communion with his Father over a period of 40 days. Luke’s Gospel is the Gospel which tells us most about the prayer of Jesus. He tells us that Jesus often retired to isolated places to pray. We are given a glimpse of him at prayer before or during some of the most crucial events of his life: after his baptism, before choosing the Twelve, alone on the mountain in hiding from people who wanted to proclaim him their king, and above all, during his agony of fear in the garden of Gethsemane the night before his death.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">He kept on saying </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Abba</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (the tender but strong word of a loving son or daughter), </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">for you all things are possible; remove this cup from me; yet, not what I want, but what you want </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Mark 14:36). Luke tells us that an angel appeared to him from heaven to strengthen him – a way of describing his Father’s comforting him. And yet </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">in his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Luke 22:43-44). One of the best aids to prayer is to try to enter into Jesus’ feelings at different occasions of his life, for his human feelings are our feelings too.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">So the first purpose of our prayer is to learn to pray as Jesus did. In describing his Transfiguration, Luke tells us that </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">while he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became dazzling white </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(9:29). In Jesus’ case this was the divine glory shining through his humanity. In our case it should be the spirit of Jesus taking over our minds and hearts.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Individual and personal</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Although we should try to imitate the prayer of Jesus, prayer is also the most personal thing we do. Just as no two sets of fingerprints in the world are alike, and no two persons are exactly the same, so too in prayer; no two people communicate with God in the same way. God has a unique relationship with each and every one of us, just as we have unique relationships with each one of our friends. It is not just that our love for some is deeper and stronger than for others, but that each relationship has a different spirit and tone and style.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">When I pray, I am alone with my God. As C.S. Lewis once wrote, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">The prayer preceding all prayers is, ‘May it be the real I who speaks. May it be the real Thou that I speak to’.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> I know I cannot pretend to be anything other than I am, because God knows me better than I know myself. There is no room and no point for the camouflage and the masks I may put on in my relationship with others. I am myself, with nothing hidden from God, but also with nothing that God does not care for. It is preparing oneself for prayer that is the real problem, rather than the actual praying. Jesus presumably did not have this same problem, because he was always ready for prayer.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Once I can come to this consciousness of a face-to-face contact with God’s presence, the response which is called for on my part is obvious. Unless I have picked up false guidance somewhere along the way, I can be confident, calm and secure. Certainly I am aware of my sinfulness, but shame and guilt are not my main feelings. Instead I feel gratitude and assurance. In deep humility I acknowledge my complete dependence on God for every breath I take and my very existence. In the words of Benedictine Brother David Steindl-Rast, all is gift.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Prayer requires no set of directions, just as true friends do not need a script when they meet. This is not to belittle the advice of spiritual writers who suggest techniques to use to keep our minds from distractions, or to keep us quiet enough to hear what God is saying. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">We can certainly follow Jesus’ advice in the Sermon on the Mount to </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">go into your room and shut the door </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Matthew 6:6). It will not matter what we say in our private encounter with God. Indeed it may even be better not to say anything.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus warned in the same context (Matthew 6:7-8) against the idea that the value of our prayer depends on the quantity of words we utter: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">When you are praying, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">After saying these words he taught his disciples the Lord’s Prayer or Our Father (Matthew 6:9-13). In doing so, it was not his intention to give them words to memorise, although we have naturally and understandably done this, because we treasure these words that come from Jesus. But rather than teach them a formula to recite, he wanted to give them a model and a spirit of prayer – an expression of total and child-like dependence on God as the giver of all gifts, which is what the ‘Our Father’ is.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The point is that prayer is a conversation with God, and there can be no true dialogue when one person holds the floor or monopolises the conversation. Prayer must also involve a listening to God. Moreover, Jesus wanted to teach that prayer is best when it is simple, and it is simple when it heeds the advice given in Psalm 46:10: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Be still, and know that I am God</span><span class="CharOverride-18">.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Now that we have grasped the value of ‘the prayer of quiet’, we may be surprised to hear that we should pester God for what we want! Yet this is precisely what we are told in the Gospel parable of the man who visits his friend late at night to borrow food because of the arrival of unexpected guests (Luke 11:5-8). It has been well said that if this story of the nocturnal nuisance were not in the Gospels, no one would ever dare invent it.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Two parables</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">According to Luke, Jesus told this humorous story to teach the need for persistence in prayer. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">A man found himself in the position of receiving unexpected guests in the middle of the night. With true eastern hospitality, he felt the obligation to feed them but he had no bread. He decided to go to his friend’s house down the road, and knocked on his friend’s door. The sleeping arrangements in a poor Palestinian household meant that the door was bolted, and a sleeping mat was probably placed against the door. The family has been asleep for hours, and it would have been a major operation even to open the door, to say nothing of waking the whole household.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The disturbed friend’s immediate reaction was to say: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Do not bother me; the door has already been locked</span><span class="CharOverride-18">. But the knocking continued, for the petitioner was sure that his pleas would be answered for friendship’s sake. Finally, Jesus says, the man of the house gave in, and at great inconvenience to himself, his wife and his children, opened the door and shoved a loaf of bread into the hands of his friend in the darkness.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Not surprisingly, it is Luke who reports a similar parable of Jesus in 18:1-5. There he tells the story, again not without humour, of an unscrupulous judge who finally gave in to the persistence of a victimised widow not because he had any conscience about justice, but because he could no longer stand the woman’s complaints.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The daring aspect of these parables lies in the comparison they make between God and a reluctant giver, and even between God and a corrupt judge. Of course we are not meant to apply these parables so literally as to picture God in either of these roles. But Jesus says we must pester the Father in the same way, secure in the knowledge God cannot become exasperated nor deny justice to those who call on him.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">But for what do we petition God? What should be the aim of our persistence and perseverance in prayer? In his own model of Christian prayer, Jesus teaches us to say Hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Perhaps this would not be our list of priorities. Probably we would put our daily bread first. But anyway, what does it mean?</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">At our best moments – moments of real prayer, or on a crowded bus – we want first things first. We do love our Father, and – empowered by God’s Spirit, and with the example of Jesus before us – like all lovers we want first of all the good and the well-being of the one we love.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">God’s ‘name’ is God’s own person. God cannot be ‘hallowed’ or made holy, being already the perfection of holiness. When we pray, Hallowed be your name, we want God to be seen as holy, accepted as holy, honoured as holy by all God’s children, all members of the human race. We want God’s kingdom to come, so that God’s love may capture the minds and hearts of all people. We want God’s will to be done, so that all may experience the healing and forgiveness, the freedom which God wills, and the happiness that follows. It also means of course that we want the secular powers to cooperate with God’s grace, so that the whole human family might experience these benefits.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Lord’s Prayer also implies a cooperation on our part to help bring about God’s kingdom of justice, love and peace – God acts through people. We cannot pray the Lord’s Prayer sincerely unless we are committed to helping achieve what God’s kingdom envisages.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">Prayers of petition</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus said: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Ask, and it will be given to you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Matthew 7:7); and again, in John 16:24: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> For what should we ask? While we acknowledge that we should ask that God’s name be held as holy, that God’s will might be done and that God’s reign might become a reality on earth as in heaven, are we justified in asking for such mundane things as a job, a home, a husband or a wife, or a healing from some illness?</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The answer to these questions, in the light of the parables of Luke 11:5-8 and 18:1-5, is surely ‘Yes’. However, the standard of our asking should be the one we use with our best friends, those we most deeply love. If we truly love another person, then a sign and quality of that love is unselfishness. Love and selfishness cannot coexist. Real love means that we want the good of the other first.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Our prayers of petition are not attempts to persuade God to do what God really does not want or choose to do! Nor do we have to inform God of our needs. Our prayers are our persistent attempt to be completely aware of our dependence on God. The more we realise we need something – health, forgiveness, employment, or whatever – the more we realise our helplessness.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This is not a disgrace, just the fact of being a creature. We have a God who wants to share graces and blessings with us. Persistent, humble prayer is the best human attitude open to what God has to give. Sincere and open prayer admits us to the mind and heart of Jesus, which in turn tunes us in to the way of the Father.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">A faith-filled life</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Whether or not we are people of prayer will be a reflection of our lives. If our life is faith-filled, then it is itself a prayer; if our prayer is genuine, then our life is faith-filled. This is how it is for all who love. Just to be in the same place as the one loved is in itself a source of pleasure and satisfaction. But it is not enough. For friends and lovers also want to reserve certain times when they do nothing but communicate with each other and really be with each other.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">So it is with prayer. Although we may do our work in the peaceful awareness of God’s presence, we can easily become absorbed by that work. Our love needs to be nourished, kept alive and stimulated by times when we do nothing but communicate with God. This is illustrated again by a couple of episodes in the Gospel of Mark. The first occurs in chapter one. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus has just begun his public ministry and made an immediate impression on the people. We are told that crowds flocked to his door. But in the early hours of the morning, he slipped off to a lonely place to be by himself with God in prayer.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Mark tells us how Simon (Peter) and his other disciples went in search of him. Their remarks when they found him carry a hint of disapproval and rebuke: Everyone is searching for you (Mark 1:37). It is apparent that they considered Jesus’ withdrawal for prayer to be a tactical error. Surely he should have been cashing in on his newly-won popularity. They failed to appreciate his need for quiet time to be alone with his Father in prayer (see Mark 1:35-39).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The other incident is described in Mark 6:30 (and following). The Twelve had just returned from the missionary tour on which Jesus had sent them (6:7). They were filled with excitement at what they had achieved. Again, his response to their enthusiastic reporting was to invite them to come away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest a while. Although prayer is not mentioned explicitly, this is surely what was behind Jesus’ invitation.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In his book </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Believing in Jesus</span><span class="CharOverride-18">, Father Leonard Foley mentions an astute observation by Ann Lindbergh. She once wrote that if her friends called to invite her to a party and she told them she had an appointment with the hairdresser, they would consider that a perfectly valid reason for not attending. But if she said she needed time for prayer, they would have been quite puzzled and unimpressed.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Without that ‘reserved’ time from our busy schedules – fifteen minutes or half an hour or even an hour, if we are fortunate enough to be able to afford that amount of time – we can easily become undernourished, less committed, less fervent. The way we pray is less important than the fact that we do it. Spending time in prayer necessarily means that we forego other activities and experiences. We must make a choice and still our restlessness. As one spiritual writer, Fr. Ron Rolheiser observed: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Because prayer can seem unreal, we often stop doing it, but it will only seem real if we persevere in it long enough and do it deeply enough. We often give up too soon. Prayer isn’t easy. It’s hard to sit still and (seemingly) do nothing when so many necessary tasks demand our attention and when so much inside us aches for activity and involvement. It’s hard to pray when we suffer from the kind of headaches and heartaches that cannot be eased by taking an Aspirin. But prayer beckons us beyond, asking us to lift even this up to God. </span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Ways of praying</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">There are different methods of prayer. One may use a set of formulas – the Our Father, the Hail Mary, the Rosary, the Psalms, etc. Such prayer may be said aloud or in silence. It gives a concrete form to expressions of faith and love, and frees one from the worry of ‘making up’ what one wants to say. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This kind of prayer should not be discounted or considered inferior, for it can be invaluable for a person in physical or emotional pain, or finding it hard to concentrate. In so many situations, familiar prayers – whether known by heart or read from a book – are an important guide and a source of strength.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Many people, however, prefer to pray in a less formal and more spontaneous way. Their prayer has no set form, and may not involve words at all. It may be simply silence in the presence of God, or it may follow some pattern. It is as hard to describe in any systematic way as a conversation between friends.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Such informal spontaneous prayer may need a focus, something on which to fasten one’s thoughts. Prayerful reading of the Scriptures may provide a good starting point. In this context, we are not reading for purposes of study, or to gain information or because we find the subject interesting. The aim is rather to listen to the voice of God so that we can respond with prayer.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Our prayer response may be in the form of adoration, praise or thanksgiving. It may take the form of expressing sorrow for sin. Again, it may be petition for one’s own needs or those of others. It may in fact be anything, as long as it comes from the heart.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">A form of prayer which has received much renewed emphasis in recent years is the so-called ‘Jesus prayer’. To some extent, this has been due to the influence of Eastern spirituality and involves the creative use of what used to be called ‘aspirations’. It is prayer which has the advantage of simplicity and is meant to be repeated, rhythmically, without haste and from the heart. Because of its rhythmic character, it is often called ‘breath prayer’ or ‘breathing prayer’.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">A simple form of such prayer is Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me. There are many short and simple prayers of this kind in the Scriptures which one may use: Lord, I believe, help my unbelief; Come, Lord Jesus, Come; Be it done to me according to your word. Another obvious example is the traditional ‘doxology’ or prayer of praise: Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end!</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Everyone with any experience of prayer will know that very often it is plain hard work. This is the reason why so many people will find any number of excuses to avoid prayer or at least put it off. We will find a hundred different things to do before beginning to pray. In this we are in good company, because even great saints and mystics have confessed that often they did not find it easy to pray.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">God is a silent and mysterious figure for the most part. We are invited through God’s self-revelation, and especially through Jesus, to be God’s friends. But the basis of friendship is truth. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The truth is that we are God’s creatures and totally dependent on God. It cannot be a relationship of equals. It is only when we admit our creaturehood and our ‘nothingness’ in comparison with God that we can become ‘something’ through God’s grace. This means an attitude of complete trust in God – often in silence, and even in the absence of any ‘enjoyment’.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">In God’s presence</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Our prayer may come down to simply being in the presence of God. This may not always be a source of satisfaction for us, but it can lead to a real sense of what it means to depend on God. Thomas Merton, one of the great spiritual directors and writers of the twentieth century, warned that prayer cannot be measured in terms of ‘usefulness’. In other words, its value cannot be calculated on the basis of ‘what we get out of it’, or whether we have a series of emotional ‘highs’ or come to clear conclusions. When these things happen, it is a bonus and reason for gratitude, but prayer is above all a matter of complete self-surrender.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Merton and others have said that we must be prepared to ‘waste time’ with God and for God; that is, we must be willing to give time to God absolutely, simply because God is our loving creator to whom we owe everything. It is not self-hatred but a simple statement of the deepest reality to say: ‘God is all, I am nothing’. I know deep down that I am precious in God’s sight but that is because God has made me so, and all the honour and praise belongs to God.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">When we say that prayer cannot be measured in terms of usefulness, we do not mean of course that it does not have fruitful effects, but usefulness is not its purpose. In the same way, friendship provides many benefits, but if these were the sole purpose for cultivating a friendship, there is really no friendship at all but only a business relationship. Some of the great saints wrote in their spiritual diaries of times of dryness, when God seemed remote and prayer itself was a tedious process. St John of the Cross spoke of ‘the dark night of the soul’. In our prayer, we have to learn patience to travel the weary path that takes us through the dry places. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Spiritual writers have remarked that these dry stretches can almost be seen as a sign of progress in prayer, as we are drawn more and more into the mystery of the cross and share that experience which caused Jesus to cry out: My God, why have you abandoned me? (Matthew 27:46).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">So prayer may come down to just ‘wasting time’ before God, that is, remaining in God’s presence without being concerned about any personal benefit, but simply being able to say You are my God. You are my all. I adore you. I love you.</span></p>

Where do we find revealed those truths which are the foundations of our faith? The usual answer given to these questions has been in the writings of the Bible and in the Tradition of the Church (from a Latin word, trāditiō, meaning ‘to pass’ or ‘hand on’). This is a view shared by all the major Christian churches, because we all look to the Bible as the main source of the basic truths of Christianity and each church has its own tradition.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">We Catholics place more emphasis on Tradition than the other churches, but this does not mean we regard Scripture and Tradition as two completely separate and distinct sources of God’s revelation. The New Testament narratives about Jesus emerge from an already active process of ‘traditioning’. Prior to the written forms, there were oral traditions about the words and deeds of Jesus. The written forms (Scripture) developed from a process of communal formation (Tradition). Scripture and Tradition are all part of the same process. God’s truth is one and indivisible, and the Bible and the Church are closely related to each other. The Tradition of the Church is really the teaching Church’s official interpretation of the Scripture. The Church’s ongoing understanding and exposition of the truth contained in Scripture is what makes up Tradition.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">What is the Bible?</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">So we come back to the Bible, the Scriptures, as the basic source of divine truth and revelation. It is important, therefore, that we have a clear understanding of what the Bible is. In this first of two chapters on the Bible, we shall look at its contents and say something about how it came into existence or how it took shape.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">If we look at the Bible from a purely human point of view and see it as literature, the first thing to note is that the Bible is not really one book at all but a small library of books of varying size and character. To be exact, our Catholic editions of the Bible comprise 73 books, 46 of which make up what we call the Old Testament (the Scriptures of the people of Israel), and 27 which comprise the New Testament. We might just note at this point that Protestant versions of the Bible contain 66 books, acknowledging only 39 Old Testament books as the true word of God, seven fewer than are found in the Catholic Bible. This is because Catholics follow the early Greek manuscripts of the Bible, while Protestants accept only the books found in the ancient Hebrew manuscripts. However, in some recent ecumenical editions of the Bible, these seven disputed books are included in a separate section.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">These 73 books represent the work of an unknown number of contributors and their composition covers a great span of time. The oldest parts of the Hebrew Scriptures were written about 1,000 years before Christ, and the last of the New Testament books was written about 100 AD. So the books of the Bible were written over a period of about 1,100 years.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Bible is therefore a collection of books by many different authors and from different periods of history.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Many books, one story</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">But we believe there is another and more important way of looking at the Bible, and that is from God’s viewpoint. When we look at it from this angle, it becomes one book. The Bible is a collection of writings which the Church has declared to be inspired by God, and to contain the truth which God has revealed to us to guide us on the way to salvation. This is a doctrine of faith which Catholics must believe: that the Bible is not only the words of people, but also the word of God.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Looked at from this point of view, the Bible has God or the Holy Spirit as its main author. The different books of the Bible, written by different human authors, thus become chapters of one great written record of God’s self-revelation to the human race, of the whole history of salvation, of one single plan to save humankind.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Both Old and New Testaments are then seen to be closely linked. The Old leads up to the New and is the preparation for the New, whereas the New Testament is the fulfilment of the Old. For the Jewish people, what we call the Old Testament is their complete Bible. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Christians however believe that the prophecies and hopes and expectations of the Old Testament are fulfilled in the person and work of Jesus of Nazareth. And so the Church, as well as taking over and making her own the Jewish Scriptures, added the Gospels and other Christian writings from the period of the early Church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Seen from God’s point of view, the redemption or salvation of the human race is one single process. From our point of view, it is a complex process and we see it unfolding in stages. It is our Christian belief that God’s plan reached its climax and its completion in Christ, but events recorded in the Old Testament like the call of Abraham, the Exodus from Egypt and the activities of the ancient prophets are also truly a part of God’s plan of salvation.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">We Christians can look back on the whole of salvation history up to the present time, and see that an event like the Exodus was just one of a whole series of interventions by God, but the fact that it happened so long ago and concerned directly the people of Israel does not make it any less real or important. It is as real an act of God’s redemption as is the death and resurrection of Christ. So we must not neglect its importance and significance for our Christian faith.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">the Old Testament</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Hebrew canon (or Scriptures) is divided into three parts: the Law, the Prophets and the Writings (the Psalms and Wisdom tradition). The books of the Old Testament were produced over a great span of time, and in some cases even a single book took many centuries to reach the form in which we have it today. This is true of the first five books of the Bible, the five books which the Jews call their ‘Torah’ or law, and which they regard as the most important part of their sacred writings. They are the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. It used to be thought that these books were largely the work of one man, Moses. But now we know they did not reach their final form until about 500 BC, many centuries after the death of Moses.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In fact they were composed by many people who collected different strands of ancient tradition. In the early stages and for a long time, the stories about Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Joseph and Moses, which are the content of these books, were handed on from generation to generation by word of mouth, before they ever came to be written down. Later on, different editors gathered these traditions together, and forged them into some kind of unity. The same goes for several other books of the Old Testament as well.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This makes the Bible difficult at times to understand. If we could say that each book had a single author, and if we knew the identity of each author and knew exactly each one’s cultural background, then the task of interpreting the Bible would become much simpler. But this is not the case. And of course the books of the Bible were written by people from a very different cultural background and with a different mentality from our own.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Law and covenant</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Book of Genesis begins with an account of the creation of the world and of the human race, then proceeds to trace the history of the patriarchs, Abraham (whom the Jews regard as the father of their race), Isaac, Jacob and Joseph.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Book of Exodus introduces us to Moses, and describes how God called him to lead the Hebrew people out of their slavery in Egypt towards the promised land. The exodus from Egypt is regarded by the Jews as the birth of their nation. It represented God’s greatest intervention on their behalf and led to the making of a covenant (or treaty) between them and God.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">‘Covenant’ is a key biblical word and idea. It means an ‘agreement,’ ‘contract,’ or ‘bond’. As a result of the covenant made at Mt. Sinai, with Moses as mediator, God made them the chosen people among all the nations of the earth. This covenant which God made with them is summed up in the words: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">You shall be my people, and I will be your God</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Jeremiah 30:22).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">For their part, they contracted to be faithful to God, and to observe the Law, summarised in the Ten Commandments proclaimed at Mt. Sinai. The making of this covenant is described in Exodus (ch.19 and the following chapters), and is the foundation of everything which follows in the Old Testament. The very word ‘testament’ means ‘covenant’, and the Old Testament as a whole is a record of the history of Israel in the light of the covenant made at Sinai. It is a sad tale, on the whole, of their continued breaking of the covenant, their recurring infidelity, and of God’s fidelity despite their disobedience. We find running through the Old Testament this cycle of infidelity, punishment, repentance and new beginning.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Israel’s journey</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The first five books of the Bible take us to the point of Moses’ death and the eve of the people’s entry into the land of promise. Other books take up the story. The books of Joshua and Judges describe the conquest of the land of Canaan and the first period of occupation. The books of Samuel and Kings record the period of the monarchy, beginning with Saul, and passing through David and Solomon and a long line of kings, </span><span class="CharOverride-18">down to the time when the nation was destroyed by powerful neighbouring enemies and the people were forced into exile. This happened about 600 years before Christ.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The whole story is one of successive triumphs and tragedies, and is told always in the light of the covenant. It is not history of the modern, scientific variety, but rather events are always described and interpreted with reference to their situation as God’s people. It is a record of God’s intervention into human history, primarily on their behalf. The biblical authors wrote with a profound faith that the hand of God was present in every event.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Despite the tragedy of the Exile and the end of the monarchy, Israel’s faith survived. This faith told them that God could not renege on promises made, and after some fifty years the historical situation changed, and the exiles (or most of them) began to return home to salvage something from the remains of their shattered nation. The story of their nation and how they set about rebuilding their Temple and the city of Jerusalem is told in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">From these humble and inauspicious beginnings, a new community was created. The covenant was renewed, and the new community pledged itself to an even greater veneration and observance of God’s law. In the few centuries before the coming of Christ, there arose the religion and way of life which we know as Judaism. Israel however was no longer to remain a powerful, independent nation as it had been in the days of David and Solomon. In fact, it passed under the political rule first of Greece and later of Rome.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">But Israel still understood God’s promises to mean that it would one day triumph over other nations. One of the features of Judaism in the last few centuries before Christ was a lively hope that God would soon send the promised Messiah or anointed one to set them free again.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Although the descendants of David no longer ruled Israel as kings, the Jews believed that the future Messiah would be a royal person of David’s line, who would prove to be a great national and political leader, who would liberate them from their oppressors, and establish an everlasting kingdom of justice and peace. It was into this people with its passionate attachment to the law and its unshakeable faith in a coming messianic age that Jesus would be born.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Prophecy and prayer</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Another important section of the Old Testament is ‘the Prophets’, the writings of men like Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel. A prophet was one who claimed and was believed to have a special call from God to interpret the will of God for the people: the prophet was God’s spokesman. He also often had the unenviable task of pointing out to rulers and people their infidelity to God’s law and covenant. For this the prophets were often persecuted, but they had an enormous influence on the political and religious history of the Jewish nation.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">There are other important writings in the Old Testament too, like the Book of Job, which deals with the problem of evil and suffering; the Book of Psalms, Israel’s book of prayer, which remains a rich source of prayers of praise and thanksgiving, petition and repentance; and the Wisdom books, which contain many proverbs or wise sayings designed to act as a guide for daily living.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">The New Testament</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">For Christians, the decisive event, or series of events in human history, are the birth, life, death and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth. Christians believe that Jesus was not only the Messiah, long awaited by the Jewish people, but also the Son of God. It is on his life, his ministry and his teaching that the New Testament is built.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The New Testament is indeed a new covenant because Jesus made possible a new relationship between God and humankind – a new way to God. Just as the old covenant made at Mt. Sinai with Moses as mediator, was sealed by sprinkling the blood of sacrificed animals (Exodus 24:8), the new covenant has been made by God with a new people, and is sealed in the blood of Jesus, God’s Son.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, we give pride of place to the four Gospels – from the old English g</span><span class="CharOverride-18">ō</span><span class="CharOverride-18">d (good) and spel (news). This is the name we give to the writings of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, who composed four versions, similar but not identical, of the gospel or ‘good news’ brought by Jesus. This good news is the message that God has come to save God’s people.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Other important New Testament writings are the letters of St Paul. Paul was the greatest missionary in the early Church. Letters that he wrote to different local churches which he had set up were later collected, and are an invaluable source of information about early Christian beliefs and practices. Paul, along with Peter, also figures as the leading character of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, a book which tells how the Holy Spirit guided the growth of the Church in the first thirty years of Christianity, from the early 30’s to the early 60’s.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Other writings that made up the New Testament are the letters of Peter, the letters of John, James and Jude, the epistle to the Hebrews, and the Book of Revelation or the Apocalypse. Each writing, in its own way, gives us rich insights into the mystery of Christ and the Church.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The new and the old</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">We tend to emphasise the newness of the revelation which came with Jesus Christ, and rightly so, because he was responsible for a new covenant between God and humankind. His teaching amounts to a new law, and the community which he founded grew into a new religion. But we must not forget the important aspect of continuity with what went before. Jesus was himself a Jew, and his Bible was our Old Testament. He did not see his mission in terms of a reversal or rejection of what went before.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">If anyone were to have any doubt about the importance of the idea of continuity, one need only read the Gospel of Matthew and take note of the numerous quotations in it from the Old Testament. This is Matthew’s way of showing that Jesus was the fulfilment of everything that the law and the prophets had proclaimed.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">As Christians we are the spiritual descendants of Abraham, and the heirs of the promises made by God to him and to Israel. While we rejoice in our vocation to be the new people of God, we are the direct descendants of the old. We must not imagine that God’s love for Israel and all God did for Israel are of no concern or relevance to us.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">When we read of God’s loving care for Israel, the wonderful deeds performed on their behalf, the promises made, we are reading of God’s eternal love for us. God’s choice of Abraham, the deliverance of Israel from Egypt, the gift to God’s people of the promised land are acts of love performed for us.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The climax of that love came with God’s sending of the Word, God’s own Son into the world. But we run the risk of failing to appreciate the full significance of Jesus, the Word made flesh, if we are not aware of those actions of God which preceded and led up to the coming of Christ. </span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">The Catholic biblical movement</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Since the middle of the last century, there has been great revival of interest within the Catholic Church in the Bible. Today, in many parishes, groups of people meet in homes – groups of Catholics or ecumenical groups – to read and discuss the Bible and to use it as a basis for common prayer. There is a diverse range of resources available, both in print and online, that can assist anyone to understand and appreciate the different books of the Bible. (You can preview some of these on the At Home with God’s People website: www.ahwgp.com/resources/the-bible-the-word-of-god).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">The beginnings <br />of the Church</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">During his public ministry of two or three years Jesus gathered around him a group of disciples, women and men. Prominent among the disciples was an inner circle of twelve men whom he chose from the wider group. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">He gave a large amount of his time and energy to their instruction and formation. On the night before his death, in the context of a lengthy farewell discourse covering chapters 13 to 17 of John’s Gospel, he promised that on his return to heaven, he and his Father would send them the Holy Spirit to be the teacher who would enlighten their minds and enable them to understand fully the meaning of all he had taught them.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">After his resurrection, the various Gospels inform us that Jesus appeared to the Twelve (or the eleven, since Judas was no longer with them) on several occasions, commanding them to go out and preach the good news to all people and to teach others what he had taught them.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In the book of the Acts of the Apostles (Chapter 2), we are told that the promised Holy Spirit came on the disciples gathered together in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost. Filled with new power and courage the Twelve now become apostles </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(from the Greek word apóstolos, ‘one who is sent’). They </span><span class="CharOverride-18">began to preach the gospel and to attract large numbers of converts to this new religious movement. They proclaimed the message of salvation brought by Jesus first to the Jewish people, and in doing so they also made use of the scriptures which had long been sacred to the Jews – what we call the Old Testament. Like their fellow Jews and their Jewish ancestors, the followers of Jesus accepted these scriptures as the word of God. In quoting from these scriptures in his early sermons, Peter would say: This is how the Holy Spirit spoke through the mouths of the prophets in days of old (2 Peter 1:19-21).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">As time passed, the original apostles and other missionaries took the gospel beyond the boundaries of Judaea to other cities and towns in the eastern part of the Roman Empire. It was mainly Paul, a convert to Christianity in the early years of the Church, who was responsible for this rapid and dramatic growth. The small community of believers thus became a Church. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Though comprised of numerous local churches scattered throughout the Roman Empire – such as those founded by Paul – these believers in local church communities gradually developed a sense of belonging to one universal Church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The other important thing to note, for our purposes, is that according to the book of Acts this growth and development was attributed primarily not to any human power or agency but to the Holy Spirit.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Early Christian writings</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The first ‘books’ of the New Testament to be written were the letters of Paul. As he moved from city to city, leaving behind small communities in the places he visited, he kept in touch with them by letters, several of which have survived. Those authentic letters of Paul which have come down to us, all seem to have been written in the decade of the 50’s in the first century.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">As the original twelve apostles began to disappear from the scene, it was considered necessary to commit to writing the content of the apostolic preaching, so that it would not be falsified or lost. It is thought that Jesus died either in 30 or 33 AD. During the first generation of Christianity, the gospel was preached or proclaimed and handed on by word of mouth, but as the first generation came to an end and the eyewitnesses of Jesus’ ministry passed into history, written Gospels or versions of the good news began to appear.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The first of our four Gospels, or so it is almost unanimously believed, was the Gospel of Mark, thought to have been written 65-70 AD, as the first generation of disciples came to its close. The Gospels of Matthew and Luke followed, probably about the period 80-85 AD, and then in the last decade of the century the Gospel of John (c 95 AD).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Three Gospel stages</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">In 1964, the Biblical Commission in Rome issued an important document on the historical truth of the Gospels. It pointed out that we must acknowledge three stages in the formation of our Gospels: </span></p>
			<p class="_8-Numbered"><span class="CharOverride-18">1.&#9;the historical basis of the Tradition, namely, the words and deeds of Jesus himself; </span></p>
			<p class="_8-Numbered"><span class="CharOverride-18">2.&#9;the period when the gospel was preached or proclaimed; </span></p>
			<p class="_8-Numbered"><span class="CharOverride-18">3.&#9;the actual composition of the written Gospels.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This document emphasised the fact that during the second stage of the process, the period of oral preaching, the apostles and their associates did not just hand on verbatim reports of what Jesus said and did, but interpreted and explained his words and deeds, and applied them to the circumstances and needs of their listeners. Similarly, in the third stage, the evangelists or writers of the Gospels had in mind the situation of the local churches for whom they wrote, and adapted sayings of Jesus and stories about Jesus to the needs and interests of their people.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is important to remember when studying the Gospels, that originally each one was written in, and primarily for, a particular local church or group of churches. Each Gospel is thus not only an account of Jesus’ life, but also gives us an insight into the life of the community for which it was written. There was a considerable period of time between the death and resurrection of Jesus and the composition of the Gospels – about 30 to 60 years. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This gave the disciples  time for faith-filled reflection on the words and deeds of Jesus and a deeper understanding of his identity and his mission. The Gospels are not therefore simple memoirs or biographies or histories in the modern sense of the term. They are in fact faith-interpretations of the person and work of Jesus whom Christians had come to acknowledge as Christ, Lord and Son of God.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Inspired by God</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">During this last third of the first century (the second generation of Christianity), other writings also appeared, including letters written by disciples of Paul and other leading church people. Eventually several of those writings (27 of them in fact) came to be accepted by the whole Church as valid expressions of Christian faith and moral teaching. It also came to be accepted that like the Hebrew scriptures, these Christian writings too were inspired by the Holy Spirit and therefore worthy of veneration along with the Old Testament scriptures as the word <br />of God.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">There was of course no instant agreement or early official decision about the exact contents of the New Testament. It was several centuries in fact before there was general agreement about precisely which books or letters should be included in the Canon or official list of the Church’s sacred writings. But eventually it became a doctrine of faith that the same Holy Spirit who was responsible for the beginning and the growth of the Church was also responsible for the production of the New Testament.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Catholics are required to assent in faith to the teaching that all the books of both Old and New Testaments have been inspired by God. The Church has declared the inspiration of the Scriptures to be a dogma of faith, but it has never defined exactly how God inspired the human authors to write down what God wanted to be revealed, without taking away their freedom. These are complex questions, particularly as we are dealing with translations of original texts which themselves have been subjected to various alterations and additions. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">As we will see later, the Church also holds that Scripture is inspired ‘for the sake of our salvation’. Scripture is inspired for God’s purpose of the salvation of human beings, not for the purpose of being an historical or scientific manuscript. However, we recognise that the books of the Bible are unlike any other literature, because they have the Holy Spirit as their principal author. As far as the New Testament is concerned, it was part of God’s creative work in establishing the Church.</span></p>

Rather, they were seen to complement each other. In later times, a separation was made between Scripture and Tradition, and it came to be taught, although it was never formally stated by the Church, that there are two sources of revelation, Scripture and Tradition, which contain those truths of faith which Christians must believe. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">At the time </span><span class="CharOverride-18">of the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, Martin Luther and others claimed, with some justification, that a conflict or incompatibility had indeed arisen between the authority of the Church and the authority of the Bible. One of the practices of the Church of this time which undermined Luther’s faith in its teaching authority was the doctrine of indulgences (the practice of the undertaking an action of reparation for the remission of ‘temporal punishment’ for sins already forgiven), which he said had no basis in Scripture.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Luther declared that in his break with the Church, he would make his stand on Scripture alone, the only true rule of faith. It is a sad fact of church history that such a conflict between the Bible and Tradition should have come about. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In earlier times, Tradition was seen as the Church’s ongoing role and responsibility to teach and interpret the basic truths contained in Scripture. Vatican II spoke eloquently about the unity of both Scripture and Tradition when it stated that both emerge from the one Divine ‘gushing spring’ and are like mirrors upon which the pilgrim Church ‘looks at God’. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Scripture and Tradition are distinct but inter-related meditations on the same Divine mystery. There is really only one source of Christian revelation, the Living Word of Jesus Christ, although Catholics believe that God’s self-communication is experienced in two ways – the written word of God (Scripture) and the living Tradition (understood as the witness and faith of the Church expressed from generation to generation). The words of Scripture and Tradition are really all one utterance. The ultimate meaning and unity of Scripture and Tradition are in Christ. They transmit a living Word that cannot be confined to Scripture alone, because (as Aquinas said) no written text could capture with complete fidelity the teaching of Christ. </span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Caution about Scripture</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">As for the Catholic Church, there was an inevitable reaction after the Protestant Reformation to the fundamental attack made on its teaching authority and to the elevation of the Bible to the status of the only rule of faith. Consequently the Church adopted a very cautious approach to the Bible. This attitude that the Bible was a dangerous book in the hands of the unskilled and uninitiated was to persist for several centuries. Catholics were not encouraged to read the Bible, but were told that all the truth contained in Scripture that they needed to know would be communicated to them through the preaching and teaching of those who were qualified, and through the liturgy. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The place of Christian art, particularly during the Renaissance and Baroque periods, was another important avenue for communicating the stories of Scripture. With hindsight, we can say that this was an over-reaction to the Protestant position, but the Church was right in exposing the dangers associated with private interpretation of Scripture.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Catholics continue to acknowledge the teaching Church as having the right and responsibility to interpret the Scriptures. As we have seen, the Bible is the Church’s book. It was the Church that decided which books should be accepted as the Canon of Scripture. As far as the New Testament is concerned, the Church was already in existence before the Gospels and letters were written. These Christian writings were composed by leading people in the Church for the members of the Church. It is our belief that the same Holy Spirit who was the originator of the Church and the inspirer of the authors of the New Testament writings continues to guide and direct the Church today and to interpret the Scriptures for its members.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Church statements</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">In recent times, the Church has moved to reverse the negative or at least neutral approach to the Bible which was the aftermath of the Protestant Reformation. Especially since the Second Vatican Council, there has been a remarkable change in attitudes at all levels of church life. But already before Vatican II, there were very positive interventions by the teaching Church which have proved invaluable in showing us how we should interpret the Scriptures.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In 1943, Pope Pius XII issued an official letter which taught that in interpreting the Bible, particularly those Old Testament books written nearly 3000 years ago, Catholic scholars and students of the Bible should take into account the different forms of expression and ways of writing that were used by people in ancient times. Although these biblical authors were inspired by God in what they wrote, they were still people of another time and culture and mentality. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Pope Pius XII’s letter also made us more aware that people in ancient times did not write history in the precise and exact way it is written today, with the same concern for the details of what actually happened. This 1943 encyclical went a long way towards freeing Catholics from thinking the Bible had to be interpreted in a literalist sense. It helped people realise that many of the Old Testament stories – like the stories of creation in the book of Genesis – were not meant to be interpreted as factual reports of how events occurred, but as popular and imaginative stories that God inspired the biblical authors to use as a vehicle for communicating religious truths.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">We have already mentioned the 1964 instruction issued by the Biblical Commission in Rome concerning the historical truth of the Gospels. This instruction made it clear that the Gospels are misunderstood if we think the intention of their authors was simply to provide their readers with biographies of Jesus, with scrupulous attention to the exact words he uttered, or to all the details of the things he did.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The contribution of the Second Vatican Council</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">A further step was taken by the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) in its document on </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Divine Revelation</span><span class="CharOverride-18">. We have seen how the Church’s doctrine about the inspiration of the Scriptures states that God is their principal author. If this is so, it should follow that the Bible could not possibly contain the slightest error on any subject, including the fields of science and history.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">However, the Council document spells it out that </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">we must acknowledge that the books of Scripture, firmly, faithfully and without error, teach that truth which God, for the sake of our salvation, wishes to see confided to the sacred Scriptures</span><span class="CharOverride-18">. In other words the truth to be looked for in Scripture, the truth which is guaranteed by God’s inspiration, is not scientific truth, and not necessarily even historical truth in matters of detail, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">but truth ... for the sake of our salvation</span><span class="CharOverride-18">.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Fundamentalism</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">This guidance of the teaching Church in the matter of how we should interpret the Bible is of vital importance at this time, because of the rapid rise of so many evangelical churches and sects which advocate a fundamentalist approach to the word of God. By fundamentalism, we mean that brand of Christianity which says we must get back to the fundamentals of the faith, and by fundamentalism they mean the Scriptures interpreted in the strict literalist sense, and applied in that literalist sense to the contemporary modern world.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Being of recent origin, these new churches give no acknowledgment to the role of tradition. They allow for no development of doctrine over the period the biblical books were written, or since that time. They make no allowance for the different cultures or the different historical contexts in which the books of the Bible were written. They place great store on the enlightenment provided by the Holy Spirit for each believing reader. They make no distinction for practical purposes between religious, scientific and historical truth, but interpret the book of Genesis, for example, as though it were a scientific text, arguing that it is a matter of faith that God actually created the universe in six 24-hour days, and that our world is less than 5000 years old.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The fundamentalist approach is poles apart from the principles laid down by the Church for the interpretation of Scripture. Because of the dogmatism of their teaching and their black-and-white approach to matters of faith and morality – based on their literalist understanding of Scripture – the fundamentalist churches have made significant inroads into the mainline churches. They appeal especially to those seeking security and clear answers in a world of such rapid and destabilising change. This phenomenon highlights how urgent it is that the major churches provide for their members opportunities for adult faith education in the area of Scripture.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Bible reading and prayer</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">It would be wrong however to think that the Scriptures can be used with spiritual benefit only by those who have the opportunity to study them in depth. We have to distinguish between the study and the prayerful reading of Scripture. While a knowledge of the Scriptures, and the contexts in which the different books were written is a definite plus, it is still possible for the most uneducated person who reads them in a spirit of faith to derive from them great spiritual nourishment.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">When reading the Gospels, for example, many people have found it very useful to imagine that they are participants in the particular episode which is being described, or among the audience listening to Jesus as he speaks. This is not make-believe, because we recall that the Gospels were written not to satisfy people’s curiosity about the details of Jesus’ life but to challenge their readers to come to faith in him. The evangelists would have intended their readers to see words addressed to Mary or Peter or Pilate or Judas as addressed also to them.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">We must also acknowledge that when we are reading the Scriptures with faith, we can expect the help and the grace of the Holy Spirit. What we should not expect (or fear) is that the Spirit will lead us in our prayerful reading of the Scriptures in a direction contrary to that which is the mind of the Church. We should read and pray the Scriptures in the company of the Church, that is, as members of a believing community which is guided by the same Holy Spirit in its search for truth. </span><span class="CharOverride-18">Catholics still enjoy great freedom in their understanding of particular biblical passages and in how they apply them to their own life-situation. We rightly recognise the Church as the rightful interpreter of the Scriptures for us, but there are very few texts in the whole Bible whose meaning the Church has formally declared as the one which Catholics must hold. Two that come to mind are the ‘words of institution’ at the end of the Last Supper (Matthew 26:26-27 and parallels) and the ‘primacy of Peter’ text of Matthew (16:17-19). For the rest, we are free to take from them any meaning or application which does not come into conflict with the totality of the faith.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In conclusion, we might choose just one quotation from the Vatican Council’s document Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation to illustrate the importance which the Church attaches to the Scriptures: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">The Church has always venerated the divine Scriptures as she venerated the body of the Lord, in so far as she never ceases, particularly in the sacred liturgy, to partake of the bread of life and to offer it to the faithful from the one table of the word of God and the body of Christ</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (no 21). Both the Scriptures and the eucharistic Body of Christ are the bread of life which gives us the nourishment that leads to eternal life.</span></p>

Many people not affiliated with any of the world’s great religions have come to recognise God’s existence, power and goodness, simply by the exercise of their own powers of reasoning. They have come to know God by reflecting on the works of God’s creation, and on the order and beauty they see in the world around them.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Over and above this, however, Christians claim to have the benefit of God’s self-revelation in the pages of the Bible, God’s own word. We know God as revealed in the Old Testament. With the Jews, with whom we share the Old Testament, we see God revealed there as a personal God of love, goodness, power, justice and mercy. But Christians are also the beneficiaries of the further revelation which God has given in the New Testament, through the personal witness of Jesus who declared himself to be the Son of God.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">A mystery of faith</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">What we can discover in the teaching of Jesus, is that God, though one, is a God of three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. From the New Testament evidence, the Church later formulated the doctrine of the Trinity, a dogma which Catholics are obliged to believe. (A ‘dogma’ is a central doctrine, understood to be ‘divinely revealed’ taught with the fullest solemnity.) The teaching Church stated this doctrine in these terms: that God is one; that there is in God only one nature; that there are in God three persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, distinct from one another and equal in every respect. All the mainstream Christian churches accept this dogma of faith.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">We call this doctrine of the Trinity a mystery of faith. It is a truth which our finite minds could never discover unless God had chosen to reveal it to us. Before Christ, this truth was unknown. The Jews had no concept of a God of three persons, although the Hebrew scriptures do contain hints of a sense of plurality in God and suggestions of divergent understandings and traditions. However, overall, the Jews were fiercely monotheistic and would have found such a concept very difficult to accept, because it would seem to put at risk their belief in God’s oneness, a truth that was so basic to their religion. Their pagan neighbours were polytheists, worshippers of many gods. This practice was abhorrent to the Jews. Their monotheism or belief in one God was the distinctive mark which set them apart, and made their worship so much superior to the idolatrous practices of other peoples. From John’s Gospel especially we learn that fellow Jews on several occasions accused Jesus of blasphemy because they understood his claim to be equal to his Father as a claim to be God.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Even though the phrases ‘son of God’, ‘sons of God’, are found in the Old Testament (for example, to describe the king or angels; and even the people of Israel as a whole is called God’s first-born son), the expression is used only in a metaphorical sense. It was certainly not intended to be understood in the same way that Jesus spoke of himself as God’s Son, when for example, he said </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">I and the Father are one</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (John 10:30).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Life-giving Spirit</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Similarly, the spirit of God is mentioned frequently in the Old Testament. But again, it was never understood in the Christian sense of a member of a trinity of divine persons. For the Jews, the spirit or breath of God was simply another way of describing the power of God. It was the spirit of God which hovered over the primeval chaos at the moment of creation, and brought order and life out of the formless mass. And God’s spirit or power is often said to fill, or move, or seize, or fall upon prophets and other leading Old Testament personalities, motivating and impelling them to speak God’s truth or carry out God’s will.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This understanding of God’s spirit as an impersonal force or power carries over into the New Testament as well. For example, when Luke describes God’s messenger Gabriel saying to Mary: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called Son of God</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Luke 1:35), there is no reason to believe that he was thinking of a personal divine being. ‘The Holy Spirit’ and ‘the power of the Most High’ are one and the same thing.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is in John’s Gospel, the last of the four to be written, that the Spirit is clearly designated as a person, or at least personified. Jesus speaks of the Spirit in this way in the lengthy farewell address to the disciples at the Last Supper, reported by John in chapters 14, 15 and 16. (See, for example, John 14:26). And by the time Matthew’s Gospel was written, probably in the 80’s of the first century, the Christians of his place had evidently come to accept the Spirit as a personal being on a par with the Father and the Son. As part of the final instructions of the risen Christ to his disciples at the moment of his departure, Matthew reports him as commanding them to baptise believers </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Matthew 28:19).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Even after Jesus’ revelation of this truth, and the Church’s later expression of it, this doctrine of the Trinity remains a mystery of faith which defies full comprehension by the human mind. We will have more to say about the Trinity when we come to talk about the part played by the Holy Spirit in our life as Christians.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus: God and man</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Standing alongside the doctrine of the Trinity, in importance, is the doctrine which is called the Incarnation. This truth, again deduced from the words of Jesus and from the New Testament as a whole, is that one of the persons of the Trinity, namely the Son, at a given moment in human history, nearly 2000 years ago, became a human being like us, Jesus of Nazareth. The word ‘incarnation’ means ‘the taking on of a human nature’. The Son of God became incarnate, became fully human, while not ceasing to be God.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Putting it in human terms, we can say that this was a joint decision taken by all three persons of the Trinity: that one of them, at a definite time in history, should become one of us. In the New Testament, the Father is usually named as the one who initiates the process: ‘God sent his Son into the world’, or ‘God gave his Son ...’</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In formulating the doctrine of the Incarnation at a later date, the Church declared that Jesus was both God and fully human, that he was only one person, a divine person, but that he had two natures, a divine nature and a human nature. Like the way the mystery of the Trinity is formulated, this is again an attempt to express in human terms what is a profound mystery of faith.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Every person is a mystery, and no one can ever know all there is to know about another. If this is true of our knowledge of one another, it is all the more true of our knowledge of God. Even though God has told us something about the divine nature by revealing the mysteries of the Trinity and the Incarnation, our understanding of these mysteries of faith is never complete. They call for a continuing and ever deeper search for understanding on our part. The words the Church has used to express these mysteries of faith are rich in meaning, and true expressions of the reality as far as they go, but they can never do justice to the reality. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The description of Jesus as God and man, that he was one divine person with a divine and human nature, provides a framework within which we seek to understand more fully where God is leading us in our search for union with God.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">God’s plan and purpose</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Only the Christian religion, of all the world’s religions, makes the extraordinary claim that God came to dwell on this earth as a human being. And it raises the question: ‘Why did God so decide? Why did the Son of God become a human being?’</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">There are several possible answers to this basic question, which has been debated at length by theologians throughout the whole history of the Church. The traditional answer is that the Son of God became human to take upon himself the whole guilt and responsibility for human sin, and to atone for that sin by offering himself as a sacrifice on the Cross to God the Father. This is the explanation found in the earliest Christian tradition, in the writings of Paul and the first three Gospels.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The idea is that sin is an offence against God, and is therefore of the utmost gravity and seriousness. Human beings alone could not atone for an offence against an all-holy God. It was therefore necessary for God to take this course of action, because the only way adequate reparation could be made to God was through one who – while fully human – was also himself a divine being. The sacrifice of Jesus, at the same time Son of God and the perfect, representative human, thus had an infinite power and was alone able to repair the injury committed against God by the world’s sin. This theological model of atonement found its most systematic expression in the works of St Anselm in the 11th century and was to shape centuries of theological reflection. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">But was it absolutely necessary for God to take such a drastic course of action as to send God’s own Son into the world, and require him to endure the humiliation and the suffering involved? Surely God could have chosen some other way. We can only answer this question through the ‘lens’ of God’s infinite love for each and every person.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">John’s Gospel especially highlights this aspect of the divine action, and enables us to answer our question, ‘Why did the Son of God become man?’ by saying ‘He did so to reveal the extent God was prepared to go to demonstrate such great love for us’.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">God’s great love</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Thus John writes: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (3:16).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">God has always loved all of creation. The act of creation itself was an act of love. The author of the Book of Genesis describes God’s creation of man and woman as the perfection of the creative work, but the subsequent narrative shows us how humanity’s surrender to the power of sin caused this image of perfection to be badly tarnished. It soon became obvious that men and women needed to be raised from their state of sinfulness if they were to live as God intended them to live.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">However, we must not see God’s sending of the Son into the world to atone for sin by his suffering and death as the act of a vengeful God who needed to be placated and appeased. Jesus did what he did freely – he was not forced by a cruel Father to die on the cross.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In his Gospel, John describes Jesus as declaring: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">I lay down my life for the sheep, and I lay it down of my own accord </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(John 10:15,18). And in his farewell talk to his disciples on the night before his death, he spelt out clearly the meaning of what he was to endure the following day: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">No one has greater love than this, to lay down one’s life for one’s friends </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(John 15:13). Jesus’ sacrifice, though in accord with the will of the Father, was an offering freely made.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Even without Jesus Christ, human beings by using their own powers of reasoning can know something of God’s goodness and love – as we saw in the opening chapter. Certainly the people of Israel, before the time of Christ, were convinced of God’s love for them. There is abundant evidence in the Old Testament that they recognised the God of Israel as a God of love. But the life and death of Jesus, God’s Son, demonstrates the divine love to an extent that we could not otherwise imagine or suspect. When we look at the cross of Jesus and reflect on its meaning, we see the love of God revealed in full clarity.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">A God who is near</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Another possible answer to our question, ‘Why did the Son of God become a human being?’ is that he did so, in order to draw us closer to him, and to make possible a knowledge and love of God that was much more real, more tangible and more intimate. As a result of the life and ministry and teaching of Jesus, God is no longer a remote, transcendent Being, separated from us by an unbridgeable gap, but someone who shares our life. When we see Jesus in action and listen to his words, we receive a much clearer and deeper insight into God’s own character, what God is really like. We learn especially that this is a God who knows each creature as an individual; a God who loves and cares for each one of us; who has a special concern for the weak, the sick, the suffering, those whom Jesus called God’s ‘little ones’; and who is a God of mercy and compassion, who desires the conversion of the sinner and takes special delight in forgiving.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">When the Son became a human being, a new relationship was established between God and the world. Any remoteness between God and the world was now overcome, for by becoming a part of God’s own creation – so to speak – God set a seal of love on the world.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">The life of Jesus</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">For all this richer understanding of who our God really is, we depend on the words and deeds, the life and death of Jesus, the Son of God. Jesus was born more than 2000 years ago, in the little town of Bethlehem, in Judaea (the southern part of present day Israel). His mother was a Jewish girl named Mary from the village of Nazareth, in Galilee (in the north of modern Israel). The Gospels of Matthew and Luke both refer to the miraculous nature of his conception. We are told that Jesus had no natural human father, but that Mary conceived her son by the supernatural intervention of the Holy Spirit. Mary at the time was preparing to marry a man named Joseph, to whom God revealed the extraordinary circumstances of his fiancee’s pregnancy. Then Joseph consented to take Mary as his wife, and become the legal father of the child. The child was given the name Jesus (in Hebrew, Yeshua or Yehoshua), a name which means ‘God saves’. </span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Proclaiming God’s Kingdom</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Gospels of Matthew and Luke recall some incidents surrounding the birth and childhood of Jesus, but we hear nothing about him from the age of twelve until his public appearance as a preacher, teacher and healer when he was about thirty years of age. In the meantime, he apparently remained in the obscurity of Nazareth, plying his trade as a carpenter, unknown outside the small circle of the people of that village.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Not until he was about thirty years of age did Jesus begin his public ministry. He was introduced to the people by John the Baptist, whose role is described in the words of Isaiah: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Mark 1:2). John called on the people to repent of their sins and be converted to the Lord, and to be baptised as a sign of their desire to change their ways. He proclaimed that God’s kingdom was about to break into human history in a new and decisive way with the coming of the Messiah.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The words Messiah and Christ mean the same thing: God’s anointed one. Messiah comes from the Hebrew, Mashiach, and Christ from the Greek </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Christos</span><span class="CharOverride-18">: the one whom God anointed or set apart for a special work. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">For many centuries, the Jews had expected the coming of a Messiah who would be the saviour of his people. John pointed Jesus out to them as the one who was to fulfil their hopes. But Jewish expectations about the Messiah were vague and often conflicting, and the tragedy is that the majority of his own people in the end failed to recognise Jesus as the one whom God had promised.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke are very similar in the way they report the life of Jesus. All three Gospels tell us that he saw the mission that the Father had given him in terms of proclaiming and establishing God’s kingdom or God’s rule of justice and love in the world. In the Gospel of Mark, the earliest Gospel, the first recorded words of Jesus are these: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Mark 1:15). This good news or gospel which Jesus proclaimed was that the time of God’s salvation had come.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Gospels then go on to record how Jesus set about his task of establishing the kingdom of God. He did this by preaching, mainly in parables, about the love, goodness, mercy and justice of God. At the same time, he stressed the need of a positive response in faith on the part of the people, calling on them to open their hearts to this God of love and forgiveness. Like John the Baptist before him, he stressed the need for repentance and conversion (change of heart) if they were to experience God’s forgiveness and enter the kingdom.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus promoted and extended God’s kingdom also by his actions, especially his miracles – miracles of healing the sick, casting out demons, raising the dead to life, even overcoming disturbances in nature. In this way, he carried out a full scale attack on the powers of evil, and consolidated God’s power and rule in the world.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">One of the first things Jesus did was to choose a group of disciples. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Gospels tell the story of an initial period of popularity, when his preaching and his miracles attracted large and enthusiastic crowds. But as it became clearer that he did not meet the expectations which many Jews had of him, the crowds began to drift away; his popularity began to wane.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">At the same time, there was growing opposition against him on the part of the political and religious establishment, who saw his teaching as subversive and a threat to their vested interests. Pharisees, Scribes and Priests joined forces to plot his downfall and death.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Finally when an opportunity presented itself, they had him arrested and handed him over to the Romans on trumped-up charges. He was tried and convicted as a revolutionary, one who aimed to set himself up as king and thus as a rival to the Emperor of Rome. He was condemned to die by crucifixion, the kind of death reserved for the worst type of criminals. He was executed on the day before the Jewish Passover feast, probably in the year 30 AD. </span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">A challenge to faith</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">This in a nutshell is the story of the earthly career of Jesus of Nazareth. No one today would seriously claim that Jesus is a myth or that he never existed. Even a serious historian not of the Christian faith would admit that Jesus was a religious teacher who lived in Palestine and gathered around him a group of disciples, that he had a reputation as a healer and a miracle worker, and that many of his Jewish contemporaries believed he was the Messiah or Christ they had been expecting. They would agree that eventually he stirred up the opposition of the political and religious authorities, who had him brought to trial and executed. Virtually all would agree on this.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">But not all would accept as factual other things which the Gospels claim. Many would deny that Jesus ever actually worked miracles, or that he ever thought of himself as the Messiah or Son of God. The non-believer certainly would not accept that after his death he left the tomb and reappeared to his disciples.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This is where faith comes in.</span></p>

			<p class="body ParaOverride-13"><span class="text-after-drop-cap CharOverride-18">ne of the striking<br /></span><span class="CharOverride-18"> things about the earthly life of Jesus is the circumstances in which he chose to carry out the mission entrusted to him by the Father. If we were asked to speculate as to how God might best discharge a plan to save humanity, we could no doubt devise more effective ways and means.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Would it, for example, not have been better if Jesus had been born into a family of power and influence, a situation in which he would have found greater opportunities to get his message across? Given the timing of his incarnation, would it not have made more sense if he were born in Rome, the capital of the civilized world?</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Instead, he was born in the humblest of circumstances in one of the most remote corners of the Roman Empire. He was born in a stable, and grew up in Nazareth, a village in the province of Galilee. Nazareth must have been a real backwater, if we are to judge from the comment of Nathaniel in John 1:46: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Can anything good come out of Nazareth?</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">His legal father, Joseph, was a carpenter in the village, and Jesus himself followed his trade. He was content to remain in Nazareth until well into his adult life, unknown except to a small circle of family, friends and residents of the village. There is no record of his having exercised any kind of preaching or teaching ministry there.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is not until he was about thirty years of age that he made his public appearance. Even then, it was a humble appearance, for he came forward with other penitents to ask John the Baptist for baptism. It was John who was inspired by God to point him out to the people as the one whom God had sent. </span><span class="CharOverride-18">Only then did Jesus begin his preaching and healing ministry.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">His ‘public life’ lasted only two years, before it ended in apparent disgrace with his death on the cross as a criminal. And even those who knew Jesus was innocent of the charges which had brought him to death, felt a deep sense of disappointment at the premature end to a life which had promised so much. The hopes that they had placed in him were shattered.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Not only was his mission so limited in time, but also geographically. The Palestine of his time covered approximately the same area as modern Israel. It was about two hundred and forty kilometres from north to south and one hundred kilometres from east to west. Only on a couple of occasions did Jesus move outside the borders of his own country – and even then, he did not go very far beyond them. He was therefore seen and heard by relatively few people in a very small area.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">What all of this highlights is the ‘incompleteness’ of his mission. By saying that his work was incomplete, we do not suggest that there was any deficiency in himself, or that his sacrifice was of limited value. No, it was a deliberate incompleteness. Clearly, God’s plan was that the task of the Son was to begin a work which others were to carry on. This conclusion is inescapable when we read the Gospel records of how Jesus went about his mission.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Slow learners</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The importance of the disciples in the ministry of Jesus and in God’s plan of salvation can be seen from an examination of the Gospels. Perhaps the best place to start is with the Gospel of Mark, the first Gospel to be written. It contains the earliest traditions about Jesus, and was published about 65 AD, approximately thirty-five years after his death.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">After his introduction (Mark 1:1-13) and the first public appearance of Jesus announcing the coming of the kingdom (1:14-15), Mark immediately describes the call of the two pairs of brothers, Simon and Andrew, and James and John (1:16-20). According to Mark, this was the first thing Jesus did after beginning his public life – which, in itself, is a clear indication of the important part the disciples are to play.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">During the first part of his Gospel (the first eight chapters), Mark reports the popularity of Jesus with the crowds, who are attracted to him because of his miracles and his teaching. But the disciples also figure prominently in the narrative.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In chapter 3, Mark describes the formal appointment of the Twelve and gives their names (3:16-19). From then on they are constantly in Jesus’ company. They hear his preaching, they witness his miracles, they rejoice in his fame and in their association with such a popular figure, they share the anxiety caused by the growing opposition to him from influential quarters. All of this is presented by Mark as a part of their ongoing formation and education.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">On many occasions Mark mentions their blindness, their ‘hardness of heart’, their failure to understand the true significance of Jesus’ words and actions. Only slowly and with difficulty do they come to understand who Jesus is, and what they have to become.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The first part of Mark’s Gospel ends with Jesus asking them the crucial question: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">But who do you say that I am?</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Mark 8:29). Simon Peter, acting as spokesman and representative for the twelve, makes his confession of faith: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">You are the Messiah,</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> the one Israel has been waiting for. This statement of Peter represents a definite advance on any degree of understanding they have displayed previously. But as Mark’s story unfolds, it becomes apparent that they still have a long way to go. Jewish expectations of the kind of person their Messiah would be, and of how he would accomplish his work, were vague, often conflicting and erroneous. Mark’s narrative shows that Peter and the rest of the Twelve shared the popular misconceptions.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Lessons on discipleship</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">They had arrived at the stage where they recognised Jesus as the Christ. The second part of the Gospel of Mark, from 8:31 to the end, poses and answers the question: ‘Yes, but what kind of Christ?’ This latter half of the Gospel is devoted even more to the formation of disciples. As Jesus’ popularity with the people began to wane, because their expectations were not fulfilled, and as the political and religious opposition to him gathered pace, he progressively withdrew from the crowds and devoted more and more of his time and energy to the training of the Twelve. They were to be the nucleus, the core-group, the leaders, of the community he was in the process of creating.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It was therefore of the utmost importance that they should come to have a deep understanding of who Jesus was, of his mission, and of what it would mean to them to be his followers. Having brought them to the point where they were able to acknowledge him as the Christ (however imperfect their understanding), Jesus now proceeds to enlighten them about how he must fulfil the mission entrusted to him by his Father.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In particular, he impresses on them that the path which has been mapped out for him in God’s plan is the way of suffering and death. Only through suffering and death will he attain glory and resurrection. The latter part of Mark’s Gospel introduces the disciples into what is called the paschal mystery. They are told that there can be no knowledge of Christ apart from the cross, and no possibility of being his disciples unless they are prepared to accept the cross as he did.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The section of Mark’s Gospel which runs from 8:31 to 10:45 is particularly instructive. It teaches that no-one can call himself or herself a disciple of Jesus, or his coworker in promoting God’s rule of justice and love, unless he or she shares with Jesus the desire to sacrifice self for the sake of others.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This was a lesson which the disciples learned only with great difficulty. Three times Jesus predicted his approaching passion, death and resurrection (8:31; 9:31; 10:33-34), and on each occasion their reaction exposes their inability to comprehend this mystery. They rebuke him for even imagining such a thing, they argue among themselves about who is greatest, they request positions of honour in the kingdom.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">His patient response to their inability or unwillingness to understand is persistent and consistent</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">: If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (8:34); </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Whoever wants to be first must be last of all and servant of all</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (9:35); </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all. For the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (10:43-45).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Service and self-sacrifice</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">And so the story moves on to its climax. It is the time of the Passover, and Jesus makes preparations to have his final meal on earth with his disciples. At this Last Supper, the night before his death, Jesus instituted the Eucharist. Jesus took bread and wine and pronounced over them the words </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">This is my body ... this is my blood</span><span class="CharOverride-18">, and, according to Paul (1 Corinthians 11:25) and Luke (22:19), added the command: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Do this in remembrance of me</span><span class="CharOverride-18">. In this way, he anticipated, by the separation of his body and blood, the sacrifice he would make of himself on Calvary the following day. By inviting them to eat and drink, he brought them into an intimate participation or communion with his own sacrificial action and shared with them in advance its life-giving effects.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is interesting to turn from Mark’s Gospel to John’s Gospel at this point. John is the only one of the four evangelists who does not describe the actual institution of the Eucharist, probably because he has already had so much to say about it when reporting Jesus’ ‘bread of life’ sermon back in Chapter 6. After feeding the 5000 people (John 6:1-15), Jesus explained to his disciples that he was </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">the bread of life ... living bread that came down from heaven</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (John 6:48, 51). He went on to say that the bread that he was giving for the life of the world was his flesh, and that it was necessary to eat his flesh and drink his blood to have eternal life (6:48, 51, 53-54). Many of his followers were unable to accept this teaching and parted company with him. Jesus asked the Twelve whether they too wanted to leave. Peter, speaking on their behalf, said: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Lord, to whom can we go? You have the words of eternal life</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (John 6:68).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">But John’s report of the Last Supper is invaluable for our consideration of how the disciples were to be the nucleus and core-group of the community he was creating to carry on his work. John’s account begins with Jesus performing the humbling task of washing his disciples’ feet. This was a teaching in action, impressing on them the need to humble themselves and put themselves at the service of others. He makes it quite explicit that they are to imitate his example.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Final instructions</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Then follow three lengthy chapters (14-16) comprising Jesus’ farewell address to them, in which he impresses on them the things they need to absorb if they are to fulfil their allotted task. One is reminded of a tutor cramming his pupils before an examination, recalling all of the important lessons they would need to remember. And in a real sense their faith was to undergo a searching examination over the next few days, when they would see him die the shameful, degrading death of crucifixion, and would feel that their hopes were buried with him.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">He tries to relieve their sadness at his impending departure. He even says it is better for them that he should go, because only then will the Paraclete, the Holy Spirit, come. The Greek word Paraclete suggests the role the Holy Spirit will play in their life and work. It suggests the ideas of advocate or counsellor, defender, comforter, and consoler. Jesus also refers to ‘the Spirit of Truth’, meaning that the Spirit will lead them into the fullness of truth, enabling them to penetrate more deeply all that they have experienced and learned from Jesus.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">He emphasises again and again the need for love of God and love of one another. He assures them of his continuing love for them, of which the gift of the Spirit is a pledge. In chapter 17, he prays to the Father for them, and asks for the gift of unity among them – that they should be one, even as Jesus and the Father are one. Only if they remain united in love will they be able to carry out the mission entrusted to them.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Despite Jesus’ urgent, last minute assurances and promises, their human weakness proves too much. When he is arrested, they flee in terror. Peter to his credit follows from a distance, but his courage fails and three times, when questioned, he denies all knowledge of Jesus. It seemed to the disciples that all their hopes and expectations for the establishment of the Kingdom perished on Calvary.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">Becoming apostles</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">But their faith and hope revived on the first day of the new week when the reports began to come in that he was alive. At first they could not bring themselves to believe the reports of the women, and indeed were all the more afraid. But that evening, he appeared to them, a fearful group huddled together for mutual support, and convinced them that he had indeed overcome death and was miraculously, gloriously alive.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">For forty days, he continued to appear to them at irregular intervals, strengthening their faith and giving them their final instructions. He tells them they must be his witnesses throughout the world. Matthew’s Gospel concludes with Jesus’ missionary mandate to the eleven disciples (Judas, of course, had defected): </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Matthew 28:19-20).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">At the Last Supper, Jesus had promised them he would not leave them orphans, but that he would send the Holy Spirit in his stead, to teach, guide, comfort and defend them. Now on the very point of his final leave taking, he repeats the assurance that they are not being left alone, with the words </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">I am with you always, to the end of the age</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Matthew 28:20).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Though reassured by Jesus’ resurrection from the dead and subsequent appearances to them, the disciples were still fearful that they might suffer the same fate as their master. They knew now what Jesus expected of them, but they were at a loss as to how they were to begin to carry out his instructions.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">After Jesus’ return to his Father in heaven, they gathered together with Mary, the mother of Jesus, some other women, and a wider group of disciples praying and waiting for the gift of the Spirit that had been promised to them. Jesus had said to them on the occasion of his leaving: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for the promise of the Father. ‘This’, he said, ‘is what you have heard from me; for John baptised with water, but you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit ...’</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Acts 1:4-5).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Holy Spirit: <br />the promise honoured</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">In anticipation of the fulfilment of this promise, they waited and prayed. The Book of the Acts of the Apostles tells us that on the Jewish festival day of Pentecost, nine days after Jesus’ departure, the disciples were gathered together, when they heard the sound of a mighty wind and saw fire, in the shape of tongues, suspended over each one of them. They suddenly became conscious of a great power possessing them: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Acts 2:4).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The transformation that was wrought in them was remarkable. From being fearful and confused they were changed into bold and fearless witnesses to Christ. They went out before the people, crowds of Jews from different countries, pilgrims who had gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the feast of Pentecost. Peter, the acknowledged leader of the disciples – now becoming apostles (ones who are ‘sent’) – proceeded to preach the first Christian sermon (Acts 2:14-41).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">He told his listeners that what they were seeing and hearing represented the fulfilment of the prophecies concerning the outpouring of God’s Spirit in the last days. He preached on the life, death and resurrection of Jesus. He proclaimed boldly that God had raised Jesus from the dead and that they (the disciples) were witnesses to this fact. Now, claiming to have received the promised Holy Spirit, he called on the people to turn away from sin, acknowledge Jesus as Lord and Messiah, and be baptised in his name. The result, Peter promised them, would be forgiveness of their sins and the gift of the same Holy Spirit.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Few sermons have had such an impact as this. Incredible as it may seem, we are told that about 3000 people believed Peter’s message, and were baptised. It is not without reason that Pentecost is still observed by Christians as the birthday of the Church.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus and the Church</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">To the question we asked in the previous chapter: ‘Why did the Son of God come among us as the man Jesus, sharing fully our human nature?’ – we can now add a further answer. The Gospel accounts reveal that one of the purposes which Jesus had in mind was to form a community of disciples. It was this community which after his resurrection grew into the Church, and the Twelve became the foundation stones on which the Church was built.</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-26"><span class="CharOverride-18">It may not be strictly accurate to say that Jesus founded a church during his public ministry, in the sense that he established a clearly structured organisation or planned in detail its future development. However, we can say that he prepared for the foundations of the Church, that the origins of the Church are to be found in his ministry. His devotion of so much time and energy to the </span><span class="CharOverride-27">training, education and formation of the Twelve was an important part of this process.</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-26"><span class="CharOverride-27">After Jesus’ departure from this earth, they came to see themselves and the new community as an extension of Jesus in time and place, entrusted with the task of proclaiming and extending the kingdom which he had launched. The basis of the Church rests not only on what Jesus said and did during his ministry, but on the whole of God’s action in and through Jesus, including his death and resurrection, and the gift of the Spirit which guided and enlightened his disciples.</span></p>

It is not a complete history of these first thirty years of the Church, but an outline of the more significant events and turning points.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The book was written by Luke, who was also the author of the third Gospel. Indeed the two books, Luke’s Gospel and Acts should be seen as volumes 1 and 2 of the same work. The theme of the second volume is stated in Acts 1:8, which reads like the programme that Luke set for himself when he wrote. According to Luke, Jesus’ last words to his disciples before leaving this earth were: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is this growth of the Church which Luke sets out to describe, not just numerically, but in its self-awareness and its understanding of its own universal character. The aim of the book of Acts is to show how the Christianity of the apostolic age evolved.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It has been rightly said that the book of the Acts of the Apostles would be more aptly called the Acts of the Holy Spirit. The names of the original Twelve are listed in 1:13, but most of them are never mentioned again in the book. It is only Peter and Paul whose activities are described in any detail. Instead, Luke attributes everything that happened in the young community to the Spirit. Every major step forward, every important decision that was made, every new direction that was taken – all is presented as the work of the Spirit. This is how Christ’s promise to his disciples in 1:8 was honoured.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Beginnings of the Church</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">At the beginning of Acts, (the first six chapters), we find the infant Church centred around Jerusalem. What distinguished Jesus’ followers from their fellow Jews was their strong belief and conviction that Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ, risen from the dead.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In the first half of the book, Peter is the leading figure. We have seen how remarkable success followed his first proclamation of Jesus as the risen Lord. Luke tells us that 3000 Jews, influenced by the visible manifestations of the Spirit, were influenced at Pentecost and others continued to be admitted daily.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">But we soon detect the first signs of opposition. The Jewish religious leaders were obviously unhappy about this successful preaching, since it implied their guilt for having instigated the condemnation and crucifixion of the Messiah. However, Luke reported that the apostles were sustained by the Holy Spirit through whose power they continued to preach and work miracles.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The first real conflict began with the preaching of Stephen. Stephen represented a view prevalent among some Jewish Christians that was particularly objectionable to the Jews. Stephen attacked the cherished belief of the Jews that the Temple was God’s dwelling place, and by implication he was critical of the law and the whole Jewish religious system. Stephen (a Greek name which means crown or garland and hence the symbol of martyrdom is often depicted as a laurel wreath) was stoned to death by the infuriated crowd, but the ideas that he voiced lived on. His version of the Gospel was one that was free of all narrowness, and so opened up the way to the reception of pagans or Gentiles into the Church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">As a result of the persecution that broke out against the Christian community, many were forced to flee from Jerusalem. This in turn led to the next stage of the Church’s expansion, throughout all Judaea and Samaria (Acts 8:1).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">‘Teach all nations’</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">An important event for Luke, the author of Acts, was the reception into the Church of Cornelius, a Roman soldier, along with his household. Peter was the one involved, but it is the Holy Spirit who directs the whole procedure. Peter was the responsible witness as the Spirit descended upon Cornelius and his family. This incident was seen by the author of Acts, as setting the precedent for the admission of Gentiles (non-Jews) into the Church. Cornelius may not have been the first Gentile to become a Christian, but Luke saw Peter’s involvement as a crucial factor.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">From Acts 11:19 onwards, we have the story of the rise of the Church in Antioch in Syria which becomes the new centre to the Church’s growth, its new missionary headquarters. It was the followers of Stephen who had begun the Church there, to be followed later by Barnabas and that unexpected convert to the faith, Paul (or Saul) of Tarsus. From Antioch the great outreach to the Gentiles or pagans began.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Luke tells us that the Holy Spirit directed Paul and Barnabas to undertake their first great missionary journey. Their labours in Cyprus and Asia Minor bore abundant fruit, as they established Christian communities in a succession of cities. The Jews in those centres for the most part rejected their message, whereas many Gentiles accepted Jesus as their Lord and Saviour.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The two missionaries returned to Antioch convinced that the Church, by some inscrutable mystery of God, was to be peopled with converts from paganism.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This sudden and large influx of former pagans into the Church caused a serious problem, as their religious background was so different from that of the Jews. The question of relations between Jewish and Gentile Christians became a major issue. Were the new converts from paganism to be obliged to observe the Jewish law?</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The first Council</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The apostles met in Jerusalem about the year 50 AD to discuss and decide upon the question, and made the momentous decision that there was to be no obligation on Gentile converts to accept the law of Moses. They handed down their decision with the striking formula: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to impose on you no further burden than these essentials </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Acts 15:28). As a compromise, they asked Gentile Christians to observe only a few requirements of the Jewish religious law, to avoid offending the sensibilities of the Jewish Christians.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Thus, in the short space of twenty years, the followers of Christ had solved, at least in principle, the problem of integration of Jews and non-Jews into the one family of faith. In doing so, they had been guided constantly by the Spirit. The Church now stood revealed as a union between God and all people in Jesus Christ.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is interesting to compare the beginning of Acts with the first two chapters of Luke’s other work, his Gospel. In both instances the Spirit is conspicuously present and active in the events and circumstances surrounding both the birth of Jesus and the birth of the Church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The fifteenth chapter of Acts marks a kind of watershed or turning point in Luke’s story, with the decision handed down by the Jerusalem assembly, or ‘council’ of the Church about the future status of Jewish and Gentile Christians. Up to this point, Peter has been the leading character in Luke’s narrative, but after chapter 15 he passes entirely from centre stage. There is no further mention of him or the other apostles, or any further report of the activities of the Jerusalem community, the mother church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In fact, from the time Paul and Barnabas begin their large-scale mission to the Gentiles, everything else fades into the background. Paul is the hero of the second half of the book of Acts. This is because he is the one most responsible, under the Holy Spirit, for the spread of the Church throughout the then known world.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Paul the Apostle</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Saul (in Hebrew) or Paul (in Greek) first appears in our story as a dedicated enemy of the Church, present as a young man at the death of Stephen and fully approving of the action taken (Acts 7:58-8:1). Paul’s subsequent miraculous conversion and his call by the Lord to preach the gospel to the Gentiles are reported no less than three times in Acts (chapters 9, 22 and 26). This in itself shows how important a figure Luke considered him to be in the early Church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Paul had spectacular results on his first great missionary tour which he undertook with Barnabas. As they travelled through Cyprus and Asia Minor during the years 45-49 there were many converts to Christianity among the Gentiles (non-Jews). </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Paul later embarked on other extensive missionary journeys which are described in the second half of Acts (15:36-28:31). On these journeys he took the gospel from Asia Minor to the continent of Europe (Greece) and ultimately, as a prisoner, to Rome itself.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">At that point, the book of Acts abruptly ends. Luke apparently considered that his purpose had been achieved. With Paul’s arrival in Rome, the capital of the Empire, Luke saw Jesus’ programme outlined in 1:8 as fulfilled: the gospel and the Church had spread from Jerusalem, throughout the whole of Judaea, and to the ends of the earth. Thus does Luke tell the story of the universal spread of the Christian religion, which had begun and is maintained by the power of the Holy Spirit.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">A theology of Church</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Paul was not only a great missionary; he was one of the greatest theologians of the early Church. He established numerous Christian communities on two continents (Asia and Europe) – in places like Galatia, Philippi, Thessalonica and Corinth – and with these churches he kept up a continuing correspondence. He also wrote to the church of Rome which he did not establish himself. Several of Paul’s letters were collected and have been recognised as part of God’s inspired word. Although mostly occasional letters, written to respond to some particular situations or deal with concrete problems which had come to Paul’s attention in the local churches, they make up an important theological interpretation of the new faith. They have added importance because they are the first Christian writings that we possess, having been written before any of the four Gospels.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Our interest at this point is in how the Christians of those early days understood the Church, and Paul’s letters are our richest source of information. Let us look at some of these images of the Church which we find in the writings of Paul and in other New Testament documents. Many of these images are taken from the life of shepherds, from agriculture, from architecture, from family life, and from marriage. Some of them also are derived from images in Old Testament prophecies which illustrate the relationship between God and the people of Israel.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Images of Church</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Church is described by Jesus as a sheepfold, to which he is the only gateway (John 10:1-10). It is a flock, of which God foretold that he would be the shepherd (Isaiah 40:11). The sheep are led and pastured by Christ himself, the good shepherd who gave his life for his sheep (John 10:11-16).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Church is a cultivated field, tilled by God. It is also called the building of God (1 Corinthians 3:9). Jesus had compared himself to the stone which the builders rejected, but which later became the corner-stone (Matthew 21:42; Acts 4:11). On this foundation the Church was built by the apostles (1 Corinthians 3:11) and from it the Church receives stability and unity.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This building is called by many names: it is the house of God in which God’s family dwells; it is also the temple of the Holy Spirit. It is interesting to see the slightly different understanding of the Spirit found in Paul’s letters compared to Acts. In Acts, the Spirit is more an external power, directing the growth of the Church through the activities of the apostles. But for Paul, the Spirit is more an interior principle of our spiritual life. Every believer is said to be a temple in which the Spirit dwells intimately, but the community as a whole is also called a temple where the Spirit resides. Into this temple, we on earth are built like living stones (1 Peter 2:5).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Body of Christ</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Paul’s favourite image of the Church is the body of Christ. This insight was probably imprinted on his mind at the time of his conversion, when he heard a voice from heaven calling: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> When he asked the voice to identify itself, the reply came: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting</span><span class="CharOverride-18">. Paul who had been persecuting the Church realised that Jesus was identifying himself with his disciples (Acts 9:3-5).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Body of Christ consists of all those whose faith has led them to receive Baptism. This sacrament signifies for Christians a fundamental change. At Baptism, Christ through the Spirit incorporates all who believe in him into his risen body: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">For in the one Spirit we were all baptised into one body</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (1 Corinthians 12:13). Like Christ, the Christian undergoes a death and resurrection; we die to the old life of sin and rise to a new life (Romans 6:1-11). Our entry into the Body of Christ is sealed by the Eucharist. Through our sharing in the eucharistic bread, we are brought into communion with Christ and with one another: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread (</span><span class="CharOverride-18">1 Corinthians 10:17). In this way all of us are members of his body (1 Corinthians 12:27), </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">and individually we are members one of another</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Romans 12:5).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Paul first used the body of Christ image in an appeal to the Corinthians to heal the divisions which existed in their community. There was evidently some jealousy and resentment directed at those who possessed certain gifts, and patronising attitudes towards those who were less gifted. Paul develops the body image to stress the coresponsibility of members for one another. In Christ’s body there is a diversity of members and gifts and functions, but the one Spirit who gives to the different members different gifts for the overall welfare of the community (1 Corinthians 12:11). Unity in diversity is Paul’s principle.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">There is some doubt among scholars whether the letters to the Colossians and Ephesians were written by Paul himself, or by one or more of his disciples. In these letters, the body of Christ image is further developed. It is said that Christ is the head of the body who holds all things together in unity, and who fills the whole body with the riches of his glory (Colossians 1:15-18; Ephesians 1:18-23).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The bride of Christ</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is in the letter to the Ephesians that we find the Church described as the bride of Christ whom he loves. </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, in order to make her holy by cleansing her with the washing of water by the word, so as to present the church to himself in splendour, without a spot or wrinkle or anything of the kind – yes, so that she may be holy and without blemish </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Ephesians 5:25-27). This idealised vision of the Church has its basis in the Old Testament where the love relationship between God and his people is also described in marriage, with God the bridegroom and Israel the bride. Paul transfers this image to Christ and the Church, and uses it to stress the fidelity and self sacrifice which is a feature of Christ’s love for his own.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">A more down to earth image of church is found in the so-called ‘pastoral letters’, the first and second letter to Timothy and the letter to Titus. It is now generally recognised that these letters were written not by Paul himself but by his disciples. They present a much more pragmatic picture of the Church. To ensure that the basic message of Jesus as taught by the apostles was preserved in its integrity, and not falsified or distorted by false teachers, the writer urged the careful selection and appointment of local church leaders and officials. It would be their primary duty to pass on the apostolic tradition as they had received it, and to protect it from all errors. We see here the beginnings of a structured church organisation with responsible leaders and officials.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The people of God</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Another idea which appears in Paul’s letters is that of a group of people in exile, who journey in a foreign land apart from the Lord and their true home (2 Corinthians 5:6). They seek the things of heaven, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God, as they wait for the full revelation of Christ to take place (Colossians 3:1-4). This picture of a pilgrim people travelling towards the promised land comes through strongly in the first letter of Peter. This letter written from Rome to Gentile Christians in a remote part of the Empire, addresses them as ‘exiles.’ (1:1); They evidently felt isolated from the surrounding society and were ostracised by their pagan neighbours. The writer therefore reassures them of the new dignity they possess as God’s people, and reminds them that in the Church they have found a new home and a new family. </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Once you were not a people, but now you are God’s people, for you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (1 Peter 2:9-10).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">All of these descriptions of the Church are important, and we should not ignore or neglect any one of them. The mystery of the Church is not able to be captured by any one image. But the description of the Church which the Fathers of the Second Vatican Council preferred was that of the </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">people of God</span><span class="CharOverride-18">. The Council teaches that God’s will is to sanctify and to save people </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">not as individuals without any bond or link between them, but rather to make them into a people who might acknowledge Him and serve Him in holiness</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, no 9).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It was for this purpose that God chose the Israelites to be his people and established a covenant with them. In God’s plan this was a preparation for the new and perfect covenant, foretold by the prophet Jeremiah (31:31-34) and sealed or ratified in the blood of Christ (1 Corinthians 11:25). The new covenant was with a new people of God made up of Jews and Gentiles – a people which would be one, not because they belonged to the same race, but because they were all baptised in the one Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:13). Those who believe in Christ are reborn from the seed of God’s word (1 Peter 1:23), and by water and the Holy Spirit (John 3:5-6).</span></p>

			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Gospels tell us that Simon was one of the first called to follow Jesus. Mark, the earliest Gospel, tells us he received his vocation by the sea of Galilee, along with his brother Andrew, and another two brothers, James and John (Mark 1:16-20). He is always mentioned first in the lists of the twelve, even with the explicit mention of the word ‘first’ in Matthew 10:2.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Frequently, Simon acts as spokesm</span><span class="CharOverride-18">an for the group. The most notable </span><span class="CharOverride-18">occasion</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> is when </span><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> asks them who they think he is. Simon speaks up on behalf of them all and says: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">You are the Messiah</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Mark 8:29; Luke 9:20).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is Matthew’s version of this incident that is particularly significant. In the Gospel of Mark, Simon’s confession of faith in Jesus as the Christ, is followed immediately by an exchange between them which shows that his grasp of the mystery of Jesus was still quite inadequate. When Jesus explains that the way the Father has mapped out for him is the way of the cross, Simon reacts strongly against this, and is rebuked by Jesus even more strongly for his refusal to accept this (Mark 8:27-33).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">According to Matthew, when Jesus asks his disciples </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">who do you say that I am?</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> Simon replies, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Matthew 16:16). In response to this, Jesus pronounces him blessed, and changes his name to Peter, a word which meant ‘Rock.’ In the literature of the time and before, there is no evidence of the word ‘Peter’ having been used at all as a personal name. Previously it had been used only as a common word meaning rock or stone.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The reason why Jesus bestows on Simon this new name is made clear in the following words. Jesus tells him that he is the rock, the foundation, on which the church is to be built, a church which will withstand the powers of evil (Matthew 16:17-19). After Jesus’ departure from this earth, Simon Peter was to be the centre of unity and stability within the community.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">A special authority</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Matthew reports that Jesus went on to say that he would give to Simon Peter the keys of the kingdom (Matthew 16:19). He also assured him that whatever he ‘bound’ and ‘loosed’ on earth would be bound and loosed also in heaven.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The precise meaning of these figures of speech can be argued, but what seems quite clear is that Simon was to possess some kind of special authority in the Church. The keeper of the keys has the power to open and shut the gate, to admit people or to exclude them. The image may imply that Peter was to be a guardian against false teaching, with authority to expel from the community those responsible.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Similarly the power to bind and loose, although difficult to pin down exactly, surely denotes some kind of real authority in decision making – in deciding on a rule of life for the community. Jesus promises Peter that any decisions he makes in this area will have God’s endorsement – ‘in heaven.’ The same assurance is given to all the disciples in Matthew 18:18, indicating that Peter’s authority is not to be exercised independently of the others. He is to be seen more as the captain of a team.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Shepherd of the flock</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Another key passage for understanding Simon Peter’s role in the early church occurs in John 21. This time the setting is after the resurrection of Jesus. On the occasion of Jesus’ arrest and trial, Peter had displayed weakness and cowardice in denying three times that he even knew Jesus (John 18:1</span><span class="CharOverride-18">7, </span><span class="CharOverride-18">25-27). Now the risen Christ invites him to make reparation for this triple denial. Three times he asks Peter, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">do you love me more than these?</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> When Peter insistently declares his love, he is told that his duty and function is to feed Christ’s lambs and sheep, that is, to be shepherd or pastor to all who will come to believe in Jesus (John 21:15-17).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The significant thing about both of these passages in Matthew and John is the note of delegated authority. By appointing Peter shepherd or pastor of the flock, Jesus assigns to him a role which elsewhere in the Bible is attributed to the God of Israel and to Christ. In Psalm 23 and in many other Old Testament passages, God is spoken of as shepherd, and, in John’s Gospel, Jesus describes himself as the good shepherd (John 10). Now Peter is called upon to exercise a similar function.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Like this commissioning of Peter as shepherd of the flock, so too, his identification as the rock has important biblical overtones. In Psalm 18 and elsewhere, God too, is called the rock on which the people of Israel is based. Paul, in his first letter to the Corinthians, identifies Christ as the rock. Now Simon, one of the twelve, is told he is to be the rock, on which the church will be built, so that the powers of death, i.e. the forces of evil, will not overcome it.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Clearly this delegation of authority to Simon Peter, expressed in language with such a rich biblical background, shows that he was seen to hold a privileged position of responsibility in the life of the early Church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It was because of his faith, that Peter was designated by Christ as the rock foundation on which the Church would be built, its centre of unity and stability. He was made the defender of the Church against the </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">gates of Hades</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Matthew 16:18), i.e. the powers of evil. He was given </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">the keys of the Kingdom of heaven</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Matthew 16:19), making him a guardian against false teaching. He was given the authority to bind and loose, that is, to make decisions for the welfare of the community.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Moreover, Peter is portrayed as the model shepherd or pastor of Christ’s flock, and his role and authority are based on his love for Jesus. As well as being a missionary group, the young Church would have to cope also with the problems of settled communities: local leadership, care of the faithful, watchfulness against dangerous innovations, in a word, pastoral concerns. It was Peter who was entrusted by Christ to oversee and provide for these needs.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In this same connection, Peter is portrayed, in the first of the two letters which bear his name, as the one eminently qualified to instruct the presbyters or leaders of local churches on how to care for their flocks (1 Peter 5:1-11).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">Peter: <br />the gospel portrait</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">There are other examples too of Simon Peter’s character and role in the New Testament. As well as being the leader of the twelve and their spokesman, he is presented as the prototype of the Christian missionary. Because he was the most prominent missionary among the twelve, and probably also because of his trade as a fisherman, there developed the idea of Peter as the great Christian fisherman or missionary. A boat, the barque of Peter, is one of the ancient images of the Church. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In the Gospel of Mark, the earliest Gospel, the call to become fishers of people is addressed by Jesus to several of the disciples (Mark 1:17), but in the later Gospel of Luke, this call is addressed specifically to Simon (Luke 5:10), in connection with a miraculous catch of fish.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">And in the last chapter of John’s Gospel, after the resurrection, it is Peter who initiates the fishing expedition (John 21:3) which ends with the miraculous catch of fish under the help and direction of the risen Christ. Peter is the one who hauls the fish ashore without the net breaking. The unbroken net is the symbol of a united, undivided Church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Yet another image of Peter to emerge from the New Testament is that of the receiver of special revelation from God (Matthew 16:18). We are told that Peter was favoured with an appearance of the risen Jesus, and according to one tradition, he was the first of the disciples to whom Jesus appeared after the resurrection. Paul quotes an ancient tradition to this effect in 1 Corinthians 15:5, and Luke confirms this in 24:34. Indeed, it was perhaps this tradition of the appearance of the risen Jesus to Peter first of all, which explains his prominence in the early Church, more than anything that happened during the ministry of Jesus. Given that in Jewish culture the women’s testimony counted for little, Peter was regarded as the first official witness of the resurrection.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Leadership in <br />the Early Church</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Peter was certainly the most important member of the twelve in the early years of the Church. We have already seen in an earlier chapter how it was he who preached the first Christian sermon on the day of Pentecost, when 3000 people came forward and professed their faith. The Book of Acts, in chapter 10, reports at length how Peter was God’s instrument in converting the Roman centurion, Cornelius, to the faith, along with his household.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Luke, the author of Acts, interprets this episode as a decisive event in the mission of the Church to the Gentiles. Indeed, he sees it as the launching of the Gentile mission.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Peter’s final appearance in the book of Acts occurs in chapter 15, on the occasion of the meeting of the apostles and elders in Jerusalem, later known as the ‘Council of Jerusalem’. At this assembly, called to decide the question of whether Gentile converts should be obliged to live by the Jewish religious law, Peter speaks first, and his speech plays a major part in the decision which is reached, exempting Gentile Christians from the burden of that law.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">No more is heard of Peter in Acts after this point, the rest of the book being mainly devoted to the activities of Paul, the great apostle to the Gentiles. In one of Paul’s own letters, to the Galatians, Paul reports a conflict at Antioch which he had with Peter for acting insincerely on the principle of relationships between Jewish and Gentile Christians (Galatians 2:11). Some would seek to find in this incident an argument against Peter’s authority in the Church. If anything, it proves the opposite. Paul claims that he was prepared to take issue even with Peter, rather than compromise on such an important matter.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">‘... a sinful man’</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">This reminds us of another New Testament portrait of Peter, less edifying and flattering, namely, that of Peter, the weak and sinful man. It is remarkable how often Peter is mentioned in the Gospels in a poor light. He is rebuked by Jesus in the strongest possible language as a tool of Satan (Mark 8:33); he is continually putting his foot in his mouth, asking Jesus what he and the others are going to get out of their loyalty to him (Matthew 19:27); boasting that he will never deny his master, whatever the others might do (Mark 14:29).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Yet he falls asleep in the garden of Gethsemane when Jesus needs his company and support most of all (Mark 14:37-38), and his self-confidence is exposed as being without foundation when he denies Jesus three times (Mark 14:66-72).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Peter was the leader of the Church when those stories were being told. He allowed them and presumably encouraged them to be told. It is almost as though he wanted to say to those who would listen: ‘Look what I was, and he still loved me. Look what I was – and see what his grace has done for me.’ Peter wanted to show himself as the best possible advertisement for the power of the grace of God.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Prototype of the Church</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">In this, too, he stands as a prototype of the community, of which he was the rock-foundation: not a community of the perfect, but a sinful Church, constantly in need of reformation, and of personal and communal conversion.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus predicted Peter’s fall from grace. But he also foretold that, having turned away from his sin and repented, Peter would be the source of strength for the other disciples (Luke 22:31-32).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Despite his weakness and failures, Peter was chosen by Jesus for leadership. We have seen the following images associated with him: missionary fisherman, pastor or shepherd, centre of unity and stability, authoritative teacher and guardian of the true faith, receiver of special revelation from God, repentant sinner, strengthener of his brothers and sisters in the faith.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">To these we might add, finally, Peter the martyr for the faith. In John 21:18-19, the risen Lord indicates to Peter the manner of his death, and how he will thereby give glory to God. Jesus’ words to Peter in John 13:36 also contain a cryptic reference to his future martyrdom, the ultimate step in following Christ. Peter is thus conformed to the image of the good shepherd who laid down his life for his sheep (John 10:11).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Although Peter’s career is not mentioned in the New Testament after Acts chapter fifteen, the evidence from tradition is strong enough to leave no room for doubt that Peter died a martyr’s death in Rome in the mid 60s. Excavations under St Peter’s Basilica in Rome have unearthed a first century Christian cemetery, and the large tomb which lies directly under the main altar is accepted by the majority of archaeologists as the probable tomb of the apostle.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">Peter and the papacy</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">This chapter has examined some important New Testament evidence about the character of Simon Peter, and about his function in the early years of the Church. If our survey of evidence were to extend to Church writings over the next few centuries, we would find further development in the Church’s understanding of Peter and his position.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It would be wrong to read back into the New Testament ideas associated with the modern papacy, or to expect to find there such notions. In this question, as in so many others, we must allow for a development of doctrine. It was not the work of a day, or even of a century, to see and propose all the dogmas of the Church in their later clarity. Some, we believe, like the primacy of the Pope, the Bishop of Rome, received their definitive explanation only in the living tradition of the Church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">But Catholics do believe that the modern papacy has evolved out of the New Testament and the early Church situation. We believe that the portrait of Peter presented in the New Testament helps us to evaluate the present role of the Pope within the Church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The promise of the primacy to Peter, described in Matthew 16, concerned the launching or beginning of the Church. The actual founding of the Church is non-repeatable; it took place once and for all. But the Church is always under construction, always in the process of being built up. It is surely reasonable to draw from the biblical passage the conclusion that implicit in Peter’s role there is the recognition of the need for one who will continue to be the rock, the basis and support of the Church. The words of Jesus surely apply to the preservation of the Church as well as its first foundation. The powers of evil (the gates of hell) referred to in Matthew 16:18 continue to assault the Church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In other words, we hold that the promises made to Peter, and the function which he was called on to perform in the early Church, were not personal privileges restricted to the life span of Peter himself, but rather something that would be necessary as long as Christ’s Church should last, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">till to the end of the age </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Matthew 28:20). The Church has a permanent need of a centre of unity and stability, a visible chief pastor or shepherd, a guardian of the true faith who will be the last court of appeal in matters of faith and morality, and one who will strengthen his brothers and sisters in the faith.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Pre-eminence of Rome</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Rome was the place of martyrdom of both Peter and Paul. Because of this, it held a privileged place in the mind of believers. Following on Peter’s martyrdom in Rome, later leaders of the Roman Church claimed to be the heirs to the promises made by Christ to Peter, and to the responsibilities which those promises involve. The relationship of the Bishops of Rome to the whole Church was not something that came to be clearly understood and formulated overnight. It took many centuries for the present understanding to be reached.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">But right from the beginning, writings which have survived from early leaders of the Roman Church reveal an awareness of their authority over, and responsibility for, the whole Church of Christ. Although this authority was not immediately acknowledged by all individual Christians, correspondence from this early period does show that the bishops of Rome were called to adjudicate and make decisions on matters affecting the welfare of various local churches. And there has never been any other serious claimant to such universal care or authority.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">During the course of history, different areas of Christendom have thrown off this allegiance to the Church of Rome. Religious and political rivalries between East and West led finally to the eastern churches declaring their independence from Rome, and rejecting the form of papal primacy which had developed. While not rejecting the pre-eminence of Rome, eastern Orthodox churches hold that Rome is the first among equals and not the centre of universal jurisdiction and oversight of the whole Church. </span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Christendom</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> </span><span class="CharOverride-18">divided</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">In the West, the Pope continued to be acknowledged as the vicar of Christ and head of the Church on earth, until the religious upheavals of the sixteenth century, which saw the Protestant reformation. To some extent as the result of the corruption and worldliness which had come to plague the Church and also the belief that the Roman Church had departed in some areas from Christ’s teaching, various groups of Christians withdrew their allegiance from Rome. Political considerations were again a factor.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Martin Luther, an Augustinian priest, was the first – and as a result of his revolt against Rome, the Lutheran Church came into existence. John Calvin was another great Protestant reformer of the time, the father of what came to be the Presbyterian tradition of Christianity. In England, Henry VIII declared himself, and not the Pope, to be the head of the local Church, and still today the reigning monarch carries the title of head of the Church of England or Anglican Church. And in subsequent centuries, the number of protestant churches has multiplied.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Recent years have seen serious attempts to reverse the divisive events of the sixteenth and following centuries, as the desire for Church unity has grown. The mainstream Christian Churches have certainly come closer together, but the papacy remains a major obstacle in the way of reunification. Again, the issues hinge less on the idea of the papacy itself and more on the historical form by which the papacy exercises its authority. In an encyclical (official letter) written in 1995, St John Paul II acknowledged that historical manifestations of the primacy of Rome had at times been the cause of division rather than be an expression of unity. In light of this, St John Paul II issued a call for a dialogue between churches on the manner in which the primacy of the Bishop of Rome was exercised. </span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">‘I am Peter’</span></p>

But there remains the important question of the kind of authority which they would find acceptable. As we have said, some churches would be happy to allow the Pope a primacy of honour.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">But this would not be in accordance with the Catholic tradition of Christianity, which holds that the Pope, as Christ’s representative on earth, possesses real authority – what we call a primacy of jurisdiction. Much work and prayer lies ahead before Christian unity becomes a reality.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Peter did not receive his authority from Christ independently of the Twelve, but rather as a member of the Twelve. There is as much discussion within the Catholic Church as outside it regarding the way in which papal authority is exercised. The manner in which the primacy of Peter is lived out is always historically conditioned by the needs of the Church. The traditional terminology has been to describe the Popes as the successors of Peter, and the bishops as successors of the apostles – a way of speaking which Protestants accept with difficulty, if at all.</span></p>

			<p class="body ParaOverride-13"><span class="text-after-drop-cap CharOverride-18">      </span><span class="text-after-drop-cap CharOverride-18">here is an order </span><span class="CharOverride-18"><br />of </span><span class="CharOverride-18">importance among the truths of faith which Catholics accept. In other words, not all truths or doctrines are equally central to the basic gospel message of Jesus. The Church does not consider beliefs about Mary as being equal in importance to truths about God – the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Catholic Church has always given prominence to Mary’s role in God’s saving plan. Especially in the past century and a half, the Church has made some pronouncements about her, like the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption. We shall consider these truths later, but for the moment, we can say that there is no explicit or even implicit statement of these beliefs in the Bible. However, the Church has always claimed to be guided by the same Holy Spirit who inspired the authors of the Scriptures. As with all Christian truth, the Church’s understanding of Mary has deepened and become clearer with the passing of time under the guidance of the Spirit.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Beliefs and teaching</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">What might appear to be new teachings about Mary are sometimes official statements or clarifications by the Church about matters that were taught and believed for a long time. Recent doctrinal statements about Mary should be seen as affirming beliefs that were already commonly held in earlier centuries of Christianity.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Again, there are some who have the wrong impression that the Church in recent times has adopted the policy of ‘benign neglect’ as far as Mary is concerned. It is not true that genuine Marian devotion is being played down, or phased out of Catholic life. Perhaps this wrong impression arose because the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) did not devote a special document to Mary, as some of the Council Fathers wished. Instead the Council treated her in a chapter (ch. 8, the final chapter) of the Constitution on the Church. As we shall see, this is surely the right perspective and the right context in which to see the role of Mary, mother of Jesus and our mother.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Second Vatican Council did warn against adopting either of two extreme positions. It mentioned the unique dignity of the mother of God, but also stated that Catholics should avoid the falsity of exaggeration on the one hand, and the excess of narrow mindedness on the other (no 67). So while beliefs about Mary should not be considered as equal in importance to the fundamental Christian truths about the nature of God and redemption, nor should Mary’s important role in God’s plan of salvation be ignored or neglected. The proper Catholic balance of Marian devotion is to consider Mary both in her privileged relationship to Jesus and her symbolic relationship to the Church as a model and woman of faith. </span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Mary in the Scriptures</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">We turn now to look closely at what the Scriptures tell us about Mary’s role in God’s plan of salvation. A careful study of the New Testament reveals a gradual development in understanding of the importance of Mary in God’s plan. The earliest New Testament writings do not assign to her any special significance. The first New Testament ‘books’ to be written were the letters of Paul, which were composed in the 50’s of the first century, and therefore only 20-30 years after the death and resurrection of Jesus. In these letters, the mother of Jesus is mentioned only once, and even then not by name (Galatians 4:4). Similarly, the first Gospel to be written, the Gospel of Mark (c. 65 AD), begins with John the Baptist introducing Jesus to the people as an adult about to begin his public ministry. There are no infancy narratives in Mark, no stories about events connected with the conception, birth or childhood of Jesus. This shows that the gospel message in the early years of the Church was proclaimed without any concentration on, or perhaps even reference to, the role of Mary.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Indeed if we had only the Gospel of Mark, we might well conclude that the mother and the family of Jesus were unsympathetic to his mission. Mark 3:21 tells us that Jesus’ family </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">they went out to restrain him</span><span class="CharOverride-18">.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">A later passage in Mark (3:31-35) implies that Jesus dismissed his mother and members of his family, and instead nominated as his true family those who did the will of God. Mark’s Jesus seems to make a distinction between his blood relatives and those who accept him in faith.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">However, the later Gospels, especially the Gospels of Luke and John, present Mary as having a positive and prominent role in God’s plan of salvation. Obviously, the Holy Spirit guided later New Testament writers to an understanding of Mary and her role that went beyond what the earlier authors understood.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Infancy narratives</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Thus the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, written about twenty years after the Gospel of Mark, include at the beginning of their accounts a description of events surrounding the conception, birth and childhood of Jesus. Naturally, Mary figures prominently in these infancy narratives (Matthew 1-2, Luke 1-2), especially in Luke’s version of events. Luke introduces Mary into his narrative in a passage (1:26-38) which describes the event commonly known as ‘The Annunciation’. In this story God reveals to Mary, through Gabriel, his angel or messenger, that he has chosen her to be the mother of his Son. Mary emerges from this account as a model for us of faith and of obedience to God’s will. T</span><span class="CharOverride-18">hese qualities are summed up in her sublime response to God’s message: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Luke 1:38).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">At this point, in the light of what we said earlier about the low profile given to Mary in Mark’s Gospel, we note Luke’s version of Jesus’ response when he (Jesus) is told </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">that his mother and ... brothers are standing outside wanting to see him</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Luke 8:20-21). If we compare this passage with Mark 3:31-35, we see that according to Luke, Jesus makes no distinction between Jesus’ family and his true disciples. Mary is certainly included among those </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">who hear the word of God and do it </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Luke 8:21).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Model of discipleship</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Her obedient response to the angel’s message in Luke 1:38 </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">(let it be with me according to your word)</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> depicts her as the first person in the Gospel story to hear the word of God and do it. She thus perfectly fulfils what Jesus describes as the mark of the true disciple. As well as being his mother, Mary was also his first disciple and the model of all true discipleship.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Then follows Luke’s account of Mary’s visit to her relative Elizabeth, who had also received – along with her husband Zechariah – a revelation from God that she was to be the mother of the one who would be known as John the Baptist (1:39-56; cf 1:13). On this occasion Luke attributes to Mary a beautiful song of joy and praise of God, known (from its opening word in Latin) as the Magnificat. In this song, Mary acknowledges the great privilege God has given her: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour, for he has looked with favour on the lowliness of his servant. Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed; for the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is his name (</span><span class="CharOverride-18">1:46-49).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Luke describes the birth of Jesus in most humble circumstances, in a stable, where he is visited by a group of shepherds who report what God has revealed to them about the new-born child: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">a Saviour, who is the Messiah</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (2:11). On hearing their testimony, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (2:19). </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">When Mary and Joseph took the child Jesus to the temple of Jerusalem </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">to present him to the Lord</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Luke 2:22), they were met by a devout old man named Simeon who was inspired by the Holy Spirit to recognise the baby as the one who had been promised by God to Israel and who would be </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">a light for revelation to the Gentiles</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (2:25-32). To Mary, Simeon addressed the words </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">a sword will pierce your own</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">soul too</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (2:35). This was a prophecy that Mary’s own faith would be challenged in a special way, and probably also contains a reference that she would experience anxiety and fear and sorrow as a result of the mission awaiting her Son.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Such fear and anxiety would surely have been felt by her in the incident described by Matthew in 2:13-15. Mary and Joseph had to take the child and make a hurried escape to Egypt, to avoid the murderous plans of King Herod who sought to destroy any potential rival. Again, Luke tells us that when Jesus was 12 years old, he was taken by Mary and Joseph to Jerusalem for the feast of the Passover. He became separated from them, and Luke tells us he was missing for three days. On finding him, in the temple, Mary in her anxiety complained: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Child, why have you treated us like this? Look, your father and I have been searching for you in great anxiety.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> To which Jesus replied: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Why were you searching for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> Luke says </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">they</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">did not understand what he said to them</span><span class="CharOverride-18">, but Mary ... </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">treasured all these things in her heart</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (2:48-51).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">The ‘woman’ <br />and the ‘hour’</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Mary appears again on two significant occasions during Jesus’ public ministry, as reported in the Gospel of John. These incidents occur at the beginning and end of Jesus’ ministry. The first occasion was a wedding celebration in the town of Cana in Galilee, at which both Mary and Jesus were among the guests (2:1-11). The second occurs beneath the cross of the dying Jesus where Mary was present in the company of the one known in John’s Gospel as </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">the disciple whom he loved</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (19:25-27). There are remarkable similarities between the Cana incident and the scene at the foot of the cross. Most significantly, on both occasions Jesus addresses his mother with the unusual title ‘woman’. The use of the word ‘woman’ to address one’s mother was certainly not the normal practice among the Jews at the time.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is also worth noting that John in his Gospel never refers to the mother of Jesus by her proper name ‘Mary’. At both Cana and the Cross, she is referred to simply as ‘the mother’ of Jesus. Taken together, these two facts suggest that John’s intention is to present her not simply as an individual. He is interested rather in her as in someone fulfilling a definite role or function.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">We see this clearly illustrated in the Gospel account of the wedding at Cana. In response to his mother’s quiet intervention, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">they have no wine,</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> Jesus finally works a miracle and changes water into wine (John 2:3). </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">We need to consider this incident at a deeper level. On this level, he rejects her intervention with words that appear at first sight brusque and sharp: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Woman, what concern is that to you and to me?</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is a statement of disengagement, the expression of a desire not to be involved: ‘What has this concern of yours to do with me?’ And the reason he gives is </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">My hour has not yet come</span><span class="CharOverride-18">. He does not mean that the time for performing miracles has not yet arrived, because he goes on to do just that. Jesus is thinking and acting on another level. While his mother was concerned about the scarcity of material wine, Jesus is thinking of the messianic wine – that is, the messianic age. More than once in the Scriptures, the messianic kingdom is described as a banquet feast, when wine will flow in abundance.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Throughout his Gospel, John gives a special meaning to the word ‘hour.’ Jesus’ hour is the hour of his death and glorification. It was an hour determined by his Father and not able to be anticipated by men. On several occasions we are told that the Jews wanted to kill Jesus, but they could not, because his hour had not yet come. But as the end of his public life draws nearer, he realises that the hour has arrived. In 12:23, Jesus says: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. </span><span class="CharOverride-18">In 13:1, John says that Jesus knew the hour had come for him to pass from this world to the Father. And he begins his beautiful prayer in chapter 17, recited on the eve of his death, with the words, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (17:1).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">A deeper meaning</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">We need, therefore, to understand the Cana episode on two levels of meaning. On the material or lower level, Mary appeals to her son on behalf of the wedding guests, and he works a miracle. On a deeper or higher level, he rejects her intervention at this point. He is saying that he has his Father’s work to do, and disengages himself from the attachments of flesh and blood. We are reminded of his words to his mother as a boy of twelve, reported by Luke: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(2:49). An alternative translation is ‘Did you not know I must be about my Father’s business?’</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">He is saying that human relationships must not affect the direction of his mission. It is only when his hour comes – on the cross – that the messianic wine will be dispensed. Jesus saw everything from the point of view of the mission entrusted to him by his Father. He interprets his mother’s intervention as a request for the messianic wine, a request he regards as premature. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Implied in his reply is the idea that Mary is to have a limited or no role in his ministry, and in fact she is not mentioned again in John’s Gospel until the cross. It must also be noted that in this story, Mary ignored Jesus’ dismissive response and instead turned her attention to the servants. Despite the layers of meaning, there is still a hint of ordinary and simple family relationships at play. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">At the cross, the hour has now arrived – the hour set by the Father, the hour when Jesus is crucified – or, as John puts it, lifted up, exalted, glorified. His messianic work is now brought to its perfection.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">All the scenes surrounding the cross in John’s Gospel (19:17-37) have a deep, spiritual meaning. So too, the incident involving the mother of Jesus and the disciple whom he loved has to be seen as more than just a personal gesture on Jesus’ part. It is not just the dutiful act of a loving son, ensuring that his mother will be cared for, when he has gone. That is part of it, but the context suggests more than that was involved.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is rather a messianic act which somehow completes his work, an act performed at the ‘hour’ when his own love and the love of his Father are fully revealed.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">He said to his mother: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Woman, here is your son</span><span class="CharOverride-18">. What is the background behind this unusual form of address? Inevitably we think of Eve, referred to in Genesis (3:15) as ‘the woman.’ John, in describing the crucifixion of Jesus, emphasises the positive aspects of Jesus’ death: his kinship, the source of unity, the giving up of the Spirit, the outpouring of life-giving water.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Mother of all believers</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">John was therefore probably thinking of the positive aspect of Eve’s motherhood. The word ‘Eve’ in Hebrew is associated with life, and Genesis (3:20) says that Adam named her Eve </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">because she was the mother of all who live.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> Now, from the time of Jesus’ hour and exaltation, Mary too becomes the mother of all those who live the new life of faith. Around the cross a new family of faith is formed, a new people of God is born, with the beloved disciple representing all the followers of Jesus. For every disciple of Jesus is loved by him. Mary for her part is the new Eve, the spiritual mother of all believers.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">If then, she played a limited role in the ministry of Jesus which began at Cana, she really comes into her own and receives her true role at the hour of his death and glorification. His hour is also her hour. And John concludes this section with the words </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">from that hour the disciple took her into his own home</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (John 19:27).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The mother of Jesus and the disciple whom he loved thus together represent the community of believers. Within this community, the Church, Mary is designated by her son to play a mother’s role. She becomes the mother of all those who through faith are brothers and sisters of Jesus. This is the reason why Catholics acknowledge Mary as the mother of the Church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Mary is thus one of the great gifts left to us as a bequest by the dying Christ. His death gave unity to his followers (the seamless tunic: John 19:23-24); as he died, he gave up his Spirit to them, the source of the Christian life (John 19:28-30); the water flowing from his side was also a symbol of this new life which he gave (John 19:31-37). And as well, he gave us his mother to be the spiritual mother of all who accept him in faith as their king and Lord.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">The second vatican Council and Mary</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Let us conclude with some observations from the Second Vatican Council about devotion to Mary and her role in the Church:</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">We have but one mediator, Christ Jesus. The maternal relationship of Mary toward us in no way obscures or diminishes this unique mediation of Christ ...</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">The Blessed Virgin was eternally pre-destined to be the mother of God. By divine providence, she served on earth as the loving mother of the divine redeemer ... She conceived, brought forth, and nourished Christ ... She was united with him in suffering as he died on the cross. In a singular way, she cooperated by her obedience, faith, hope and love, in the Saviour’s work of restoring supernatural life to souls. For this reason she is a mother to us in the order of grace.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">This motherhood of Mary in the order of grace began with the consent which she gave in faith at the Annunciation, and which she sustained without wavering beneath the cross. And now in heaven, she does not lay aside her motherly role, but by her many acts of intercession continues to win for us gifts of eternal salvation.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">By her motherly love, she cares for the brothers and sisters of her son, who still journey on earth surrounded by dangers and difficulties until they are led to their happy homeland ...</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">With her as our model, the Church grows in faith, hope and love, searching out and doing the will of God in all things. In our apostolic work we rightly look to her who brought forth Christ, so that through the Church, Christ may be born and grow in the hearts of the faithful also. The Virgin Mary in her own life lived an example of that motherly love which should motivate all who cooperate in the mission of the Church, for the rebirth of all men and women.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">devotion to Mary</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Catholics honour Mary for two reasons: firstly because of her unique role as mother of Christ and secondly, because she is a model of faith. Because of these two dimensions, Catholics have formed a special devotion to her. They see her not as a goddess or a superhuman being, but as one of them. But because God chose her to be the mother of his own Son, Jesus, they hold her in particularly high regard. She too was human, she had to be redeemed, she had to live in faith and hope, like the rest of us.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">As with the other saints of the Church, we see her as a model and an inspiration for our Christian life. We believe also in her power of intercession with the risen Lord, her Son.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Again, as with the other saints, we pray not so much </span><span class="Bold CharOverride-18">to</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> her as with her, recognising that God alone is the One who ultimately accepts and grants our prayers. The invocation we make to her is Pray for us, that is, speak on our behalf, intercede for us with your Son. We see her as the mother of the Church, the first among the saints, praying with the Church and for the Church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Marian prayer which Catholics learn from early childhood is the ‘Hail Mary.’ The first part of this prayer is strictly biblical, containing the words addressed to Mary by God’s messenger, Gabriel, and by her relative, Elizabeth: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb,</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> Jesus. After the Council of Trent (16</span><span class="CharOverride-28">th</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> century), the Church formally added the second part: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> </span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Rosary</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The great prayer honouring Mary is the Rosary, a devotion which is a meditation on the important events in the lives of Jesus and his mother. It comprises twenty ‘decades’, each consisting of the Our Father, ten Hail Marys, and the prayer in praise of the Trinity: ‘Glory be to the Father ...’</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">These </span><span class="CharOverride-18">twenty</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> decades or mysteries are divided into four groupings: the Joyful Mysteries; the Mysteries of Light; the Sorrowful Mysteries, and the Glorious Mysteries.

			<p class="body ParaOverride-35"><span class="CharOverride-18">Devotion to Mary has received great impetus from alleged appearances made by her to children in various parts of the world. Some of the most famous and most popular include at Guadalupe in Mexico (1531), Lourdes in France (1858), Fatima in Portugal (1917). A Catholic is not obliged to believe in these ‘private’ revelations, though millions accept their truth. At least in the case of Lourdes, well-documented and scientifically tested miracle cures make it difficult not to accept that the power of God has been at work in response to Mary’s intercession.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Feasts and doctrines</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">During the Church’s liturgical year, there are a number of feast days celebrated in honour of Mary. Two of these feasts celebrate two dogmas about Mary proclaimed in recent Church history: the Immaculate Conception, promulgated by Pope Pius IX in 1854, and celebrated on December 8; and her Assumption into Heaven, promulgated by Pope Pius XII in 1950, and celebrated on August 15.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The first of these doctrines (the Immaculate Conception) proposed to Catholics for their acceptance in faith that Mary herself was conceived free from original sin. Because of her privileged choice by God to be the mother of his son, the belief of the Church is that she was redeemed ‘in advance’ at the moment of her conception, as we are by Baptism. At Baptism, we say to the newly-baptised: you have become a new creation. Put simply, this is what is at the heart of the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of Mary.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Assumption is an expression of belief that Mary, because of her faith and holiness and motherhood of Jesus, has already been admitted in her full personhood (body and soul) into the enjoyment of the full and eternal vision of God – a state which for the rest of saved humanity will come at a later time. We say in the Creed, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">I look forward to the resurrection of the dead</span><span class="CharOverride-18">. Put simply, this is what is at the heart of the doctrine of the Assumption. Both doctrines assert that the hopes of our faith have already been fulfilled in Mary. Mary is the model and pioneer of faith. Mary does not possess a different ‘kind’ of humanity from the rest of the human family.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Neither of these doctrines is contained in Scripture. Neither can be ‘proved’. They are a matter of faith and were part of the Church’s traditional faith long before the dogmas were proclaimed. A feast celebrating the Immaculate Conception of Mary goes back many centuries.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Another important Marian feast is that of Mary, Mother of God, celebrated in the Church on the first day of the New Year. This does not mean of course that Mary is the mother of the eternal Trinity of persons. However, because her son Jesus is truly God as well as truly man, she is rightly honoured as mother of God.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Mary’s virginity</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Both Luke and Matthew agree on the virginal conception of Jesus, that is, that Jesus had no human father, but was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, as the Creed affirms (see Luke 1:34-35; Matthew 1:18-25). As various forms of Christian witness developed, the conviction that Mary remained always a virgin came to be held as Catholic doctrine. The Gospels leave undecided the question of the ‘brothers’ and ‘sisters’ of Jesus (Mark 6:3). Holding onto the idea of Mary’s virginity, the ancient Church fathers (early Christian writers) interpreted these passages in various ways. Some, for example, particularly in the East, suggested that Joseph married Mary as an elderly widower and already had children of his own. Others suggested that the terms ‘brothers’ and ‘sisters’ were best understood to mean ‘cousins’ and broader kindred, and it is this interpretation which has become the standard. By the 4</span><span class="CharOverride-28">th</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> century, particularly through the writings of St Jerome, the Church had come to see Mary’s life-long virginity as part of her commitment to her Son and his mission.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Such ‘development of doctrine’ remains a point of difference between Catholics and Protestants, though it is worth noting that the leading Reformers – Martin Luther, John Calvin and John Wesley – all defended the perpetual virginity of Mary. It was later generations of Protestant reformers, particular during the Enlightenment period of the 1</span><span class="CharOverride-18">8</span><span class="CharOverride-28">th</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> </span><span class="CharOverride-18">century, who developed the dominant view of mainline Protestant theology that these ‘brothers’ and ‘sisters’ were ‘true siblings’ of Jesus.</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-36"><span class="CharOverride-18">Mary’s virginity should be seen as more than a physical or biological issue. It rather symbolises her profound attitude of total openness to God alone. Mary is a figure and symbol of the Church, and her virginity is a prophetic sign of the Church’s total dedication to Christ. She is the ideal Christian, </span><span class="CharOverride-18">completely given only to God.</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-36"><span class="CharOverride-18">A modern Protestant theologian has written of this aspect of Mary with great insight: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Her unique relationship with the Spirit sets her in such close proximity to God that she must remain alone in order to point out to our eyes this unique choice of her Lord ... Her virginity appears at one and the same time as a sign of consecration and a sign of solitary powerlessness which gives glory to the fullness and power of God ... a sign of poverty, of humility, and of waiting upon God ... a sign of emptiness and total trust in God who makes rich such poor creatures as we are</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Max Thurian, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Mary, Mother of All Christians</span><span class="CharOverride-18">).</span></p>

			<p class="body ParaOverride-13"><span class="text-after-drop-cap CharOverride-18">od sent the Son, Jesus Christ</span><span class="text-after-drop-cap CharOverride-18"><br /></span><span class="CharOverride-18">into our world to become one of us. God did this so that people might identify with Jesus, and from hearing the words and witnessing the deeds of Jesus, might come to know and love God in a way that otherwise would not have been possible.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus in turn saw an important part of his mission as the creation of a visible community or society. One of the first acts in his ministry was to call a group of disciples around him, and this community was to become his church which would see its duty as one of serving and praising him in communion with other believers, as well as carrying on his mission to the world.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">And finally, Jesus laid the basis for the sacraments of the Church whereby, through his ministers and the community, he would reach out and touch with his grace those he called to be his own.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The response of faith</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">In speaking of the sacraments, the Second Vatican Council’s Constitution on the Liturgy (no. 59) stressed the importance of the need for faith in connection with their celebration. </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">The purpose of the sacraments, it says, is to sanctify people, to build up the body of Christ, and to give worship to God. Because they are signs that also instruct. They not only presuppose faith, but they also nourish, strengthen and express it.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> The need for faith in connection with the celebration of the sacraments is of primary importance.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Gospels note how on several occasions during his ministry Jesus demanded faith on the part of those who approached him, requesting to be healed or forgiven. Again we see a parallel between the earthly ministry of Jesus of Nazareth and the activity of the risen Christ through the Church (and specifically through the sacraments). Faith – as the required response to the healing, forgiving, sanctifying and life-giving activity of Christ – is as necessary today as it was during the earthly ministry of Jesus.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">A sacrament must therefore be entered into with faith and love. Christ always gives us grace unless we deliberately put obstacles in his way. We can block his grace by receiving certain sacraments when we carry in us serious, unrepented, unforgiven sin. When the sin is later forgiven, the grace of the sacrament is then restored.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The sacraments also intensify our faith, and our love for God and our fellow men and women. Each sacrament makes us more like Christ. The more we share in his sacramental life, the more we are transformed and drawn to him. But only through faith are we able to celebrate and participate fully in those saving actions of Christ.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">What is faith?</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Traditionally, faith has been identified as one of the three main Christian virtues: faith, hope and charity or love. Paul identifies these as the three most important Christian gifts (1 Corinthians 13:13). He goes on to say that the greatest of these is love, but that should not cause us to underestimate the importance of faith. In fact, faith and love are closely related. They are gifts of the Spirit, the effect of God’s presence within us, but we still have the obligation to try to develop them.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It would be a mistake to see faith just in terms of an intellectual assent to truths or propositions put to us for our acceptance: I believe that God exists; I believe that Jesus Christ is truly God and truly human, that he rose from the dead, and so on. In every act of faith, our intellect certainly has a part to play, but there is more to faith than that.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Our faith is the way we respond to God’s presence in our lives. As in the formation of every relationship, the response must be at every level of our being – mind, heart and will. It involves not only the acceptance of a creed, but a whole way of life, which implies love, commitment and permanence. It is a free and personal decision to surrender to God’s invitation. It is a fundamental conversion towards God, the ability to say ‘yes, I believe’ to what God teaches and asks of us, and to commit ourselves to live by God’s teaching.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Every person’s journey to faith is different. For some, God is so real that their faith response is easy and uncomplicated. For others, the journey is full of doubts, uncertainties and anxieties. Everyone has different experiences of God and different capacities to form relationships. We can all make our own the prayer of the father of the epileptic boy who pleaded for a cure for his son. Jesus told him: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">All things can be done for the one who believes</span><span class="CharOverride-18">. His reply was </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">I believe; help my unbelief!</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Mark 9:23-24). Jesus cured the boy, showing that a sincere prayer of faith does not go unanswered. But we are all at different levels of faith.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Faith and doubt</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Uncertainty and doubt may not disappear with the coming of faith, and they can coexist with faith. Faith is not knowledge that frees us from doubt but is a gift that makes it possible for us to live with doubt. Like Peter we are invited to risk walking on the waters, and even though like him we might seem to be sinking, our faith in God enables us to continue with confidence. It provides us with a certain direction, meaning and purpose to our lives.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is not God’s way to overwhelm us with ‘proofs’ that force us to believe. The resulting submission would no longer be faith. In love for us, God seeks to persuade, rather than compel, our assent. God wants our response to be free because real love cannot be forced. A compelled love is no love at all. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">There can indeed be times in one’s life when faith is at a low ebb. At such times, the importance of the support of other members of the believing community (family, friends, fellow Church members) becomes particularly apparent. For faith is not a purely private or personal response on the part of the individual to God. While a personal relationship with God or Christ is important, the faith of each person is part of the whole Church’s response to God’s self-revelation, that is, part of the faith of the Church. Just before the Sign of Peace at Mass, the priest prays on behalf of all: ... look not on our sins, but on the faith of your Church .... It is this faith, evidenced in the lives of so many believers past and present, that is our support in times of difficulty.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In times of serious doubt, we should also be humble enough to seek guidance, both human and divine. Doubt need not be the enemy of faith, but the threshold to a more mature and authentic faith. We should remember the experience of so many believers throughout the centuries, beginning with Abraham, the great biblical model of faith, who put his hand into the hand of God and went out into the darkness. We have the assurance of so many of the saints of the Church that periods of great doubt and crises of faith (the so-called ‘dark night of the soul’) can lead to a new, more mature and realistic faith in God.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">A developing faith</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">As is the case with every relationship, so too one’s faith can either grow or weaken. Our faith response to God’s</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> self-revelation is not something final or static but is continually on the move, because God is present to us in an active way in our daily lives. Faith isn’t just about knowledge or information. Faith is primarily about relationship. Our faith is challenged and re-arranged through all the events of our life. We don’t have all the answers and we never will, but we can let our questions lead us to deeper truths. Faith must grow and develop; otherwise it will wither and even die. In other words, as we have said, faith is a dynamic relationship, a living encounter between God and self, whereby we grow continually in our understanding of God and God’s will for us, and commit ourselves to live by this.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">As time passes, and we reflect on our initial understanding of God and God’s will for us, our faith will gradually broaden and deepen. Teachings which may at first seem strange, difficult or even unimportant gradually come into focus and, even though some difficulties may remain, the pattern becomes easier and easier to grasp. If this process of growth is to take place, we must keep ourselves open to the Spirit of God whose task is to clarify the truth (John 14:26; 15:26; 16:13).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">However, the way faith comes to a person is a mysterious process. Prayer, study, meeting with other believing people and experiences of various kinds can all play a part in how each person is led to faith. However, when all is said and done faith is a free gift from God which cannot be earned. Others may assist in bringing someone to faith, but only God can give faith: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God – not the result of works, so that no one may boast </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Ephesians 2:8-9).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Because it is a gift, and like every gift has to be freely accepted, faith can also be rejected. A relationship can never be forced on anyone. One person may reject faith, because what is proposed for belief seems untrue. Another may say ‘no’, because he/she sees the implications of faith and is unwilling to change a way of life. The journey to faith can be a painful process, since it may involve conversion of mind and heart and change of habits. Such radical conversion usually takes place only when there has been honest self-appraisal undertaken with courage over a period of time. It means putting aside established prejudices and being open to truth wherever it may lead. Obviously the process may not be an easy one. No birth is ever painless.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Faith in action</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">A measure of our growth in faith is the way we live. Towards the end of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus says: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord’, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only one who does the will of my Father in heaven</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Matthew 7:21). Discerning what is God’s will for us is a constant challenge. The Ten Commandments provide a basic rule of life; and the sermon on the mount represents a development of the old law, which Jesus said he had come to fulfil, or perfect, or complete. Above all his teaching was that the whole law could be summarised in terms of love.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">A sign of the authenticity and depth of faith is that it flows over into a life of love, and is translated into good works. Paul speaks of </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">faith working through love</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Galatians 5:6). In 1 John 3:18, we read </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">let us love, not in word or speech, but in truth and action. </span><span class="CharOverride-18">Our love should not be just words or talk, but must be sincere and show itself in action. James in his letter tells us that </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">faith without works is also dead</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (James 2:26). This is his conclusion to an argument in which he asks what good is it for someone to say that he has faith if his actions do not prove it. Such faith will not save a person, James warns: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">If a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food, and one of you says to them, ‘Go in peace; keep warm and eat your fill’, and yet you do not supply their bodily needs, what is the good of that? So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(James 2:14-17). Jesus’ dramatic description of the final judgement (Matthew 25:31-46) also reminds us that judgement rests on the performance or non-performance of good works.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It may sometimes appear that ‘unbelievers’ show more faith by their exemplary lives and works of charity than some who profess to be Christian. By following their conscience they respond to God’s call even though they might be quite unaware of God or any call. It is true that not all works of charity or virtuous living are signs of faith, but they at least indicate a closeness to God that is only a step removed from faith. On the other hand, many believers show the weakness of their faith by their frequent failure in the area of love of neighbour.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In conclusion, faith is the way we respond to God as God is revealed to us in our daily lives. It is a dynamic relationship, a living and continual encounter with God, whereby we grow continually in our knowledge of God and God’s will for us, and commit ourselves to live our lives accordingly. Faith is the basis of our life with God in this world. In the next life, it will give way to vision, when we shall see and know God face to face (1 Corinthians 13:12).</span></p>

			<p class="body ParaOverride-13"><span class="CharOverride-18">    </span><span class="text-after-drop-cap CharOverride-18">ne of the distinguishing</span><span class="CharOverride-18"><br /></span><span class="CharOverride-18">features of the Catholic Church is the importance which we attach to what we call the sacraments. They represent a particular understanding of the relationship between Christ and his Church, and indeed Creator and creation, which is characteristic of the Catholic tradition.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The term ‘sacrament’ was used more widely in the early Church than it is today. In the first six centuries, Christian writers (especially those we call the Fathers of the Church) used the Latin word sacramentum (an oath that Roman soldiers took on entering the army) to describe various aspects of the nature and life of the Church, and especially Baptism. In the Middle Ages, the term ‘sacrament’ came to have a more precise meaning and it became necessary to determine which of the Church’s ancient practices fitted best the more precise definition of the term.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">By the thirteenth century, there was agreement about the number of sacraments (seven) which Catholics and Orthodox Christians recognise today. The Protestant reformers, taking the approach that only those sacraments should be retained which Jesus could be shown in the Scriptures to have clearly instituted opted for just two sacraments – Baptism and the Eucharist. But although it took time for the Church’s formal understanding of the sacraments to develop, the actual practice of the sacraments was part of Christian life and worship from the early centuries.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading ParaOverride-38">Jesus: <br />sacrament of God</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Before proceeding any further, we need to recall what we have said in earlier chapters about God, Jesus Christ and the Church. This will enable us to situate the seven sacraments of the Church in their rightful context in God’s plan of salvation. This is a necessary step, because to consider the sacraments in isolation would inevitably lead to a distorted understanding of their place in Catholic belief and practice.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The sacraments are a prime example of God’s ‘incarnational’ way of approaching and relating to human beings. By this we mean that God chose to share the divine life with us not in an invisible or purely ‘spiritual’ way, but through persons, events and things that we can touch and experience through our senses. The Catholic Church teaches that the first and primary sacrament is Jesus Christ himself. God chose to save humanity and to communicate his life and grace by becoming a man who lived and walked among us.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">What we have said earlier about the identity of Jesus of Nazareth shows the appropriateness of describing him as the sacrament or sign of God’s presence in the world. Many holy men and women in the history of Christianity like Francis of Assisi, Thérèse of Lisieux, Vincent de Paul, and Mary MacKillop have been true ‘signs’ of God’s presence in the sense that their virtues and life-style directed the thoughts and aspirations of people towards the God they served. The same can be said of people of our own time, like a Mother Teresa of Calcutta or a Pope John XXIII.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">But only Jesus can be fully the sacrament of God’s presence, the fully effective sign, because – uniquely – he is both God and human. In Matthew’s Gospel, he is called Emmanuel, which means God with us (1:23). Jesus himself, when asked by his disciple Phillip to </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">show us the Father</span><span class="CharOverride-18">, replied, ‘</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Whoever has seen me has seen the Father’.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (John 14:8-9). </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">When the Word became flesh and lived among us</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (John 1:14) God began a new way of relating to human beings. In Jesus, God descended to our level to become accessible to our senses. Jesus is indeed the sacrament, the loving sign of God’s presence in the world.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">The Church: <br />sacrament of Jesus</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">It can also justly be said that the Church is the sacrament of Jesus Christ. We refer to what was said in an earlier chapter about Christ and the Church. Jesus of Nazareth lived on this earth for a relatively short span of time, and covered a very limited space of territory. Comparatively few people had the privilege of seeing or hearing or touching him in the flesh.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Before he left the world to return to his Father, Jesus laid the groundwork for the continuation of the work he had begun. Matthew who began his Gospel by identifying Jesus as Emmanuel (God with us) concludes it with the promise of the risen Christ to his disciples: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">I am with you always, to the end of the age </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Matthew 28:20).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The belief in the continuing presence of Christ with his Church meant much more to the early Christians than just the inspiration of his memory. St Paul, the first great interpreter of the person and work of Christ, understood this profoundly. In the book of the Acts of the Apostles, Luke, the author, in describing the sudden and dramatic conversion of Paul, says Paul heard a voice from heaven, asking: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">why do you persecute me?</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> According to Luke, Paul up to this point had been a persecutor of the followers of Jesus. Now in his confusion, he asked: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Who are you, Lord?</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> And the reply he received was</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">: I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Acts 9:4-5). Luke’s description of the circumstances of Paul’s conversion may explain the identification of Christ with the Church that we find in his letters. It was Paul who introduced the image of the Church as the body of Christ.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Out of such biblical insights came the view that the Church can be seen as the sacrament or effective sign of Christ’s continuing and permanent presence in the world. The bishops at the Second Vatican Council took up this understanding of the Church as a kind of sacrament of intimate union with God, and of the unity of all humankind.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">To call the Church a sign of Christ’s presence in the world may seem an extravagant claim to make, because members of the Church are far from perfect. John positively reminds us that those who say they have not sinned deceive themselves (see 1 John 1:8-10). Membership of the Church does not ensure sinlessness, but is a call to holiness and perfection (see Matthew 5:48) and to promoting and advancing God’s kingdom (see Matthew 6:10). By responding to this call, the members of the Church help to build up the Body of Christ so that it becomes more and more the sacrament of Christ in the world.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">During his lifetime on earth, Jesus himself established certain ways of sharing his life and power with humankind. We have reports in the Gospels of how Jesus sent out the Twelve and others of his followers (Luke mentions ‘seventy-two’ in his Gospel) and for their mission gave them a share in his own power and authority. He even promised his disciples: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">the one who believes in me will also do the works that I do and, in fact, will do greater works than these</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (John 14:12).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In other words, Jesus used certain people as visible human channels of the same grace that was at work in him. It is our belief that he meant all his followers, the whole Church, to be a sacrament of God’s grace to the world – a means by which his grace and power would enter the world after his return to the Father. This is what is meant by calling the Church a sacrament of Christ.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Besides using persons to carry on his mission and communicate his grace, Jesus also employed specific actions and objects as visible signs of the life and blessing he came to give. Water was one such sign, as when Jesus was baptised by John and the Holy Spirit descended upon him (Mark 1:9-11). He used ordinary food to show the power of God. His first miracle in John’s Gospel was to change water into wine (John 2:1-11), and later he multiplied bread and fish to feed the hungry crowd (Mark 6:35-44; 8:19). By action and gesture, he communicated the grace and power of God. He often touched people when he healed them, even lepers (Mark 1:40-45), and used clay and spittle to open a blind man’s eyes (Mark 8:22-26). He breathed on his disciples to give them the Holy Spirit (John 20:22), and on the night before he died, he made use of bread and wine to give them his body and blood (Mark 14:22-25).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">All of these instances are Jesus’ use of ‘signs’ or ‘symbols’ – specific persons, gestures and objects, which visibly symbolised and conferred God’s abundant grace and blessings. It is because Jesus himself established certain ways or ‘channels’ of sharing his life with people that the Church recognises a number of sacraments. Symbol and ritual are important elements in the Church’s celebration of the sacraments.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">The Sacraments <br />of the Church</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The seven sacraments recognised by the Catholic Church are all based upon some aspect of Jesus’ life or teaching, even though he did not explicitly command his followers to carry out all of them after his departure from the earth. The sacraments emerged as a distinctive part of the Church’s life as the apostles followed Jesus’ example and carried out his teaching. We shall see examples of this later. Although it took time for the Church’s formal understanding of sacraments to develop, the actual practice of these sacraments was a vital part of Christian life and worship from the first century on.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">When we say that Christ instituted the sacraments, therefore, we do not claim to have explicit biblical evidence that Jesus himself left to his Church a fully developed sacramental system. In many cases it was the Church which chose the sign most appropriate to express the grace attached to a particular sacrament.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">God’s self-giving love which was present in Jesus is now present in the Church. It is present in a special way in those significant actions or signs of the Church which we call sacraments. Through them Christ makes a gift of himself in different ways, depending on the effect which each sacrament is intended to produce. Each sacrament has its own ‘sacramental grace’.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Celebration <br />of the Sacraments</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The way each sacrament is celebrated by the Church is meant to reveal God’s entry into our lives. It makes God’s intervention visible and tangible, so that we can actually experience Christ’s grace-filled action, his giving of himself.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Second Vatican Council acknowledges this teaching function of the celebration of the sacraments. In the Constitution on the Liturgy (no. 34) we find the words: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">The rites (of the sacraments) should be distinguished by a noble simplicity; they should be short, clear, and unencumbered by useless repetitions; they should be within the people’s power of comprehension, and normally should not require explanation. </span><span class="CharOverride-18">In the same Constitution (no. 59), the Council summed up the purpose of the sacraments: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">The purpose of the sacraments is to sanctify people, to build up the body of Christ, and to give worship to God. Because they are signs, they also instruct. They not only presuppose faith, but they also nourish, strengthen and express it.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The celebration of the sacraments, in revealing God’s entry into our lives, causes not only personal growth in grace on the part of the individual recipient, but also the building up of the whole community. It is this aspect, the building up of the community, which has led to the recent renewed emphasis on the communal celebration of the sacraments, in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Second Vatican Council.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Origins in Scripture</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par ParaOverride-39"><span class="CharOverride-18">Let us turn now to look briefly at the individual sacraments.</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-13"><span class="Bold CharOverride-9">Baptism: </span><span class="Bold CharOverride-18">J</span><span class="CharOverride-18">ohn the Baptist promised that the one coming after him would baptise with the Holy Spirit (Mark 1:7-8). John’s own baptismal practice was a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins (Mark 1:4). It was a symbolic purification rite, and not the Spirit-filled sacrament of Christian Baptism.</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-39"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus told the Jewish religious official Nicodemus: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (John 3:5). The risen Lord commanded his disciples to baptise all nations </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Matthew 28:19). Luke reports in Acts 2:41 that after the first Christian sermon preached by Peter on the day of Pentecost, about 3,000 people requested and received Baptism.</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-40"><span class="SACRAMENTS-IN-TEXT CharOverride-18">Confirmation: </span><span class="CharOverride-18">In the Acts of the Apostles, there are several references to the apostles laying hands on newly baptised believers, as a result of which they received the Holy Spirit (Acts 8:14-17 and elsewhere). Here we see the basis for the sacrament of Confirmation.</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-13"><span class="SACRAMENTS-IN-TEXT CharOverride-18">Eucharist:</span><span class="Bold CharOverride-18"> </span><span class="CharOverride-18">There is clear biblical evidence for Jesus’ institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper (1 Corinthians 11:23-26; Mark 14:22-25; Matthew 26:26-29; Luke 22:14-20). In the versions of Paul (1 Corinthians 11:25) and Luke (22:19), after Jesus </span><span class="Bold CharOverride-18">pronounced over the bread and wine the words </span><span class="Bold CharOverride-18">This is my body ... this is my blood, </span><span class="Bold CharOverride-18">he commanded his disciples </span><span class="Bold CharOverride-18">Do this in remembrance of me.</span><span class="Bold CharOverride-18"> At every celebration of the Eucharist, the Church acts in obedience to this command of Christ.</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-39"><span class="Bold CharOverride-18">In the case of Baptism and the Eucharist, the signs (the actions and the symbols of water, bread and wine) can be shown to have come directly from Jesus himself. It is the Church which has decided on the elements of the other sacraments, but again we can find a biblical basis for the Church’s sacramental practice.</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-40"><span class="SACRAMENTS-IN-TEXT CharOverride-18">Penance or Reconciliation: </span><span class="Bold CharOverride-18">The sign element of some sacraments has changed in the Church’s practice over the centuries, and the practice of the sacrament of Penance in the early church is not clear. However, its basis can be found in John 20:23, in what the risen Lord said to his disciples:</span><span class="Bold CharOverride-18"> If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.</span><span class="Bold CharOverride-18"> It is a significant and important work of the Church to continue the forgiving ministry of Christ.</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-30"><span class="SACRAMENTS-IN-TEXT CharOverride-18">Anointing of the Sick: </span><span class="Bold CharOverride-18">In the letter of James (5:13-16), believers are advised of the procedure to follow, should any member of the community fall ill. Again we can see the basis of the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick, which is an extension of the healing ministry of Jesus himself.</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-30"><span class="SACRAMENTS-IN-TEXT CharOverride-18">Marriage:</span><span class="Bold CharOverride-18"> Jesus emphasised the ideal of marriage as a permanent, indissoluble union (Mark 10:2-12; Matthew 19:3-9); and Paul (or a disciple of his) described married love as a symbol of the union between Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5:32).</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-13"><span class="SACRAMENTS-IN-TEXT CharOverride-18">Holy Orders:</span><span class="Bold CharOverride-18"> </span><span class="CharOverride-18">The basis of the sacrament of Holy Orders can be found in the words and actions of Jesus at the Last Supper with respect to the bread and wine, and especially in his words </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Do this in remembrance of me</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (1 Corinthians 11:24; Luke 22:19). Although it took a little time for the idea of the Eucharist as a sacrifice to develop, the elements of the Christian priesthood can be seen in the eucharistic words and actions of Jesus.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">Why seven sacraments?</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">There is a sense in which every person, action, thing and event in the world can be sacramental, that is, can reveal to us God’s presence. Certainly every Christian is called to be a sacrament of Jesus’ love and forgiveness and healing. And whether Christian or not, every human being has the power to show the face of God to others, for: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">God is love, and those who abide in love abide in God, and God abides in them</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (1 John 4:16 see 1 John 4:7-21).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">But the Church has recognised seven sacraments which in a special way bring us in touch with God and mediate God’s love to us at certain important moments in our lives. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">For example, at Baptism (usually celebrated soon after birth), a person is ‘born anew’ or ‘born from above’ by water and the Holy Spirit. The one who is baptised is born into God’s own family. Confirmation and Eucharist complete the process of initiation: Confirmation, by a strengthening of the Holy Spirit, and Eucharist, by providing the nourishment necessary for our spiritual health and life, just as food and drink are needed to sustain and preserve our physical life. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Penance or Reconciliation acknowledges the fundamental human need for forgiveness. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Marriage sanctifies the union of two people who are prepared to make a life-long loving commitment to each other.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Holy Orders ensures the provision of leadership in the community, and provides a focus of unity and the ongoing proclamation of God’s word.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Anointing of the Sick is available for those who need God’s strength when the body or mind fails. So at each critical moment of our journey through life, Christ, acting through the Church, stands ready to provide the necessary help.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Of course, God can touch people’s lives in many different ways, other than through the sacraments. Thus, forgiveness and healing can be asked for and received through personal prayer and the performance of good works. But although there are other means available for contact with God and Christ, for Christians the sacraments are significant meeting points, not least because they allow us to celebrate our experience of Christ’s saving activity throughout our lives.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">God’s signs of love</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">A special feature of sacraments is that they take account of the fact that we are not purely spiritual beings, but creatures of flesh and blood with a physical and a spiritual dimension to our lives. The spiritual dimension is normally reached through our senses of sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell. It is these senses that God uses to communicate deeper realities.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The need for such visible and tangible signs as the seven sacraments rests on our human need for assurance. We know God loves us, just as we know that many people love us – husband or wife, parents, children, friends. But if they give us no external sign of love – no word, no touch, no gift, no smile – it becomes difficult to remain convinced of their love. The sacraments are the signs of God’s love expressed and celebrated through the Christian community, and are absolute assurances of that love. We know that God forgives our sin and welcomes us to the table of the Eucharist, because God’s Church does.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Familiar signs – new meanings</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is important to appreciate the ‘appropriateness’ or the sign value of the symbols which the Church uses in the celebration of the sacraments. They are signs which were meaningful to people in ancient biblical times, but are also familiar to people of almost every nation and culture: washing with water, laying hands on a person’s head, sharing a meal, anointing with oil. In each sacrament the sign used teaches us something about the grace of the sacrament, the ‘sacramental grace’ or particular aspect of God’s loving initiative which is attached to each sacrament.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Thus in Baptism, the Church uses water, which is richly symbolic. It suggests cleansing, satisfying thirst, but in a special way, life. Life cannot exist without water. It is the ideal element for the celebration of a sacrament which brings about a new birth into a new family of faith, and a sharing in the life of God.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Also used in Baptism is oil, which is the principal element used in the sacraments of Confirmation, Anointing of the Sick and Holy Orders. Oil is an ancient biblical symbol used to convey the idea of God’s commissioning someone for a special function. Priests, prophets and kings of Israel were all anointed as signs of being commissioned by God for their particular tasks.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Oil was also used by athletes to make their bodies strong and supple, and it is as a sign of strengthening as well as of commissioning that it is used in the sacraments of Confirmation and Holy Orders.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Another property of oil is its healing, soothing quality, which is prominent in the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Similarly bread and wine, chosen by Christ to communicate his gift of himself in the Eucharist, are universally accepted as means of nourishment. Moreover, wine, as well as being appropriate because of the visual resemblance to blood, suggests the festive joy of a banquet.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Because the sacraments are designed to meet our needs (and one of our needs is to celebrate), in every sacrament there is celebration. We celebrate welcome (Baptism), the acceptance of mission (Confirmation), the peace of forgiveness (Reconciliation), the joy of marriage, the response to a special vocation (Orders), the strength given the sick, and overall a share or communion with God’s own life (Eucharist).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Continuing <br />contact with Christ</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The sacraments are therefore an expression of the Church’s faith that Jesus continues to make contact with his people today by his actions. No longer do we have the opportunity of being able to encounter the historical Jesus of Nazareth in the flesh, as did those disciples who walked the roads of Galilee with him nearly 2000 years ago. During his time on earth Jesus healed, he drove out the powers of evil, he consoled, he strengthened, he encouraged, he gave life, he conferred authority on those whom he called.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Through faith we are still open to personal contact with the human Christ acting through his Church, and in a special way, through the sacraments. The same life-giving, forgiving, healing and loving Christ who ministered then works through his Church today. That is our Christian faith and hope.</span></p>

Christ acting through the Church performs these signs; and a faith-filled response to them and participation in them are an important means of holiness and salvation for individuals and for the whole Christian community.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In this chapter we are going to look more closely at two of the three sacraments which are known as the sacraments of initiation into the Church: Baptism and Confirmation – the other being Eucharist.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Catechumenate</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Bishops at the Second Vatican Council called for the restoration of the Catechumenate in the Church. The restored Catechumenate, or to give it its full title, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (RCIA) has been hailed as one of the most important results of the Second Vatican Council for the life of the Church. This is because it is designed to bring home to both catechumens and to ‘born and bred Christians’ the full implications of what it means to be born into Christ. It reminds all that the only possible way of approaching the Christian life is to see it as a process of total, lifelong, deepening ‘conversion’.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The process, which comprises several stages, reaches a climax at the Easter Vigil. At this ceremony the catechumens, now known as the elect, receive the sacrament of Baptism.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">On the same occasion, all members of the community are invited to renew their baptismal promises. These solemn actions cannot fail to move the ‘born Catholics’ to reflect on what it means to be a baptised Christian, and on what commitment to Christ really involves.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Biblical images of Baptism</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">We can use different images to describe what it means to be a baptised Christian. Paul spoke of being grafted onto the vine who is Christ, and thus empowered to bear fruit (Romans 11:17). The new Christian begins an entirely new life, is a </span><span class="CharOverride-18">new creation</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (2 Corinthians 5:17), called to put aside the old self, and becomes a member of the Body of Christ. By Baptism, we become living members through which the life of the risen Christ flows and acts.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The word ‘christening’ has been somewhat weakened and deprived of its force. Radically, though, it is a beautiful expression: ‘being christened’ means being made one with Christ, or con-formed to Christ. At Baptism, a person enters into the life of the Trinity, being baptised ‘in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit’. In the ancient Hebrew language, the word ‘name’ was practically synonymous with ‘person’, for one’s name conferred identity.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">All of these images contribute to express the wonderful effects produced in us by the sacrament of Baptism: grafted into Christ the vine; made a new creation; incorporated into the Body of Christ; conformed to the likeness of Christ; and entering into the life of the Trinity. Paul, whose imagery is so rich and diverse, also speaks of becoming a temple of the Holy Spirit, because it is by Baptism that the Spirit comes and makes a home in us.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">We become adopted children, sons and daughters, of the Father, given a share in the divine life. The newly baptised can now call God ‘Abba, Father’. Jesus Christ is their brother (see Romans 8:14-17), and all other baptised Christians are their brothers and sisters in Christ. The author of the first letter of John cried out in admiration: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and that is what we are </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(1 John 3:1).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The state of the baptised Christian is summed up by Paul in a phrase which could hardly be more simple but is so profound as to defy human understanding: we are ‘in Christ’. And this makes every other mark or identification tag (racial, social, or sexual) of quite secondary importance: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">As many of you as were baptised into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Galatians 3:27-28).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">A spiritual re-birth</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The New Testament emphasises the importance of Baptism in receiving God’s gift of salvation. We have already seen Jesus’ reply to Nicodemus when Jesus said it was necessary to be ‘born again’, and Nicodemus (foolishly or facetiously?) asked if that meant he should enter his mother’s womb again. Jesus’ reply to this odd question was: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (John 3:5).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The author of the letter to Titus, a disciple of Paul, also stresses the importance of Baptism: God</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18"> saved us, not because of any works of righteousness that we had done, but according to his mercy, through the water of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Titus 3:5). This is a clear reference to Baptism.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">And the author of 1 Peter, a disciple of Peter, emphasises the same point: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">when God waited patiently in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight people, were saved through water. And baptism, which this prefigured, now saves you</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (1 Peter 3:20-21).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is on the basis of such texts of Scripture that Catholic Christians view Baptism as the first step in accepting God’s salvation. We also have the last words attributed to the risen Christ at the end of Matthew’s Gospel: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Matthew 28:19). Although on the evidence of the Acts of the Apostles, Baptism was first conferred in the name of Jesus, as a sign of union with the person of Jesus himself, by the time the Gospel of Matthew was written (50 years later), Baptism was into the name (person) of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">According to Luke, the author of the Acts of the Apostles, the Twelve began to fulfil their commission on the day of Pentecost, just seven weeks after Jesus’ death and resurrection. Peter exhorted the crowd of Jews who had gathered: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Repent, and be baptised every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ so that your sins may be forgiven; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Acts 2:38). There are several other passages in Acts which emphasise that in the early Church Baptism was seen as the first step in becoming a Christian (see also Acts 8:12-13; 8:36-38; 9:18; 10:47; 16:15; 19:5).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The first effect of Baptism mentioned by Peter is the forgiveness of sins. The water of Baptism retains the symbolic effect of washing and cleansing, the symbolic value of the Baptism practised by John the Baptist who saw the external washing as a symbol of an interior conversion. The primary symbolism however of the water of Baptism is that of new life brought about by a re-birth.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Original sin</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Original sin is not an easy concept. We are not specifically searching for the ‘first’ sin (and therefore, the very first sinner) as if involved in a moral archaeological quest. Original Sin is best understood as a generic and universal human reality and condition of sin. The idea of ‘original sin’ comes to our attention firstly, not as a moment from human history but as a question about our everyday human experience. As we reflect on who we are, we come to the same realisation as Paul, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do. Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells within me</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Romans 7:19-20). As we think about who we are and how we live, we realise that, despite our best intentions, something goes awry. As much as we desire God, we do, in small and large ways, reject God’s goodness in our life. We only need to look at the world to realise that for all this world’s beauty and joy, there also lurks a terrible darkness and despair. Where does this come from?  </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">That is the question that the people of Israel attempted to answer in the Book of Genesis. The first eleven chapters of Genesis describe in story form the coming of sin into the world and its effects. It tells Israel’s version (with the help of ideas borrowed from other near-by cultures) of how, in the beginning of time, the human race became estranged from God by the deliberate sin of our first ancestors. As a consequence of their sin, alienation from God quickly multiplied so that the whole human environment became corrupted and contaminated. The world became alienated from God as a result of human sin. As a result, we are all born in the condition which is called ‘original sin’. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Paul speaks of the whole of creation waiting for redemption (Romans 8:22). Everyone born into this sinful world is somehow touched and spoiled by the climate and the power of sin. Prior to any decisions we make as human beings, there is an inclination active within us to make choices away from what is ultimately good and true and beautiful. We live with the incapacity to fully embrace what is of God. We have a longing for God, for the Infinite, but we live in a world which requires finite choices. This necessity to make decisions and choices about who we are and how we live is hindered and mired by this incapacity to fully reach for the Love which calls to us. Our fear of finitude and death narrows our response to the Infinite. We turn away from Love and seek fulfilment in the ‘here and now’ and we frequently turn that which is positive in our lives into means of destruction. Respect can become envy, passion can become violence, desire can become obsession, pleasure can become addiction, and self-esteem can become self-centredness. History teaches us that human beings and human societies can swing wildly out of control and commit the most horrendous crimes and cruelties. There is no clearer example of ‘original sin’ than the damage that human beings have wreaked on one another in both spontaneous and calculated ways throughout the course of time.  </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18"> However, this Infinite Love (God) which we can reject is infinitely greater than our lack. Baptism frees us from this sinful environment, as well as from personal sin in the case of adults, so that we can enjoy the freedom of the sons and daughters of God (Romans 8:18-25). This does not mean that the baptised are free from the influences of evil, but they are assured that they need no longer be enslaved by these influences because they can call on God’s power which is in them. Sin need no longer be their master.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Conversion, turning away from sin, is a life-long process. Baptism is not a once-for-all completion of our union with God. Like every birth, it is a beginning, and needs to be lived out daily for the rest of our life. There are no ‘converts’, only people in the process of being converted.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Although original sin is mentioned only once in the new baptismal rite, it remains a doctrine of the Church. It receives less attention only because the baptismal liturgy concentrates on the more positive aspect of new life.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">As well as mentioning the need for repentance, and the consequent forgiveness of sins, Peter in his first sermon also spoke of the baptised receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38). Paul developed this idea when he said </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">for in the one Spirit we were all baptised into one body ... and we were all made to drink of one Spirit</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> <br />(1 Corinthians 12:13).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Dying and rising with Christ</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Paul also compared Baptism to being buried with Christ, a burial that results in death to sin and the ‘old nature’, resurrection to life with God, and putting on a completely new nature. He wrote: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Do you not know that all of us who have been baptised into Christ Jesus were baptised into his death? Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life ... The death he died, he died to sin, once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Romans 6:3-4, 10-11).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Baptism is a participation in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is commonly administered by the pouring of water over the head of the candidate but the sign is most meaningful when the candidate is immersed in water, as was done in the early days of Christianity. The candidates were led down the steps of the baptismal pool, often in the shape of a tomb, and immersed or ‘buried’ beneath the surface of the water. They were then raised up, and led up the steps on the other side of the pool – to share the life of the risen Christ.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Baptism is thus seen as a sign of dying and rising with Jesus himself. With him we are raised to new life: we already begin to live the risen life. When Paul wrote</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">, I have been crucified with Christ,</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> he was thinking not only of the physical suffering he had to endure for Christ’s sake, but of his death to his old self, and to all the values and attitudes of that former existence which were not Christ-minded. And so he would exclaim in joy and wonder: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Galatians 2:20).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">The baptism of infants</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The first converts to Christianity were adults. The New Testament does not explicitly state whether infants or children were also baptised, but there are some indications that they were. Immediately after Peter urges his listeners to be baptised (Acts 2:38), he adds the words: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">For the promise is for you, for your children, and for all who are far away, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to him</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (2:39). The New Testament also speaks on several occasions of the baptisms of whole households, which in normal circumstances would include children.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It has been convincingly argued that the attitude of Jesus to the children who were brought to him for his blessing was probably preserved as part of an early Christian liturgy for the Baptism of infants and children.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">People were bringing little children to him in order that he might touch them; and the disciples spoke sternly to them. But when Jesus saw this, he was indignant and said to them, ‘Let the little children come to me; do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs. Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it.’ And he took them up in his arms, laid his hands on them, and blessed them.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Mark 10:13-16)</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The fact that Jesus did not refuse to bless children, and taught that the kingdom of God belongs to the likes of them, influenced the Church in its practice of baptising infants and children.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">At least from the third century on, there is conclusive evidence that infants were baptised, and by the fifth century this was a universally accepted practice throughout the Church. Nor is there any evidence of any important Church leader denying the validity of infant Baptism during the first few centuries of Christianity.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In Christian countries the great majority of candidates for Baptism continue to be infants. While infants have no need to have personal sins forgiven and are not able to offer a personal response of faith, the practice of infant Baptism is a recognition of Jesus’ particular nearness to children. It also emerges from the wisdom of the Church that recognises that families (and the Church) are enriched when faith is a tangible feature of the earliest memories and experiences of childhood. However, there are some Christian communities which demand that Baptism be deferred until the person is able to make his or her own decision for Christ. For this reason, infant Baptism is not universally practised among Christians today. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Catholic Church, like all the mainline Christian churches, understands Baptism as an action of Christ welcoming a new member into his family. At that moment, it is true that the one being welcomed is too young to take a conscious part in the proceedings, but nevertheless Baptism marks the beginning of the life-long process of conversion. The coming to faith and the growth in faith which accompanies conversion are a gradual on-going process. The presentation of an infant for Baptism should presuppose the kind of environment in which the child will receive the education and example that will lead him or her to become more aware of the value of God’s gifts and of Christ’s call to follow him.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Community <br />and parental responsibility</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Rite of Baptism makes clear where the opportunities and responsibilities lie. There is a sense in which the whole local church community has a part to play in bringing the child to </span><span class="CharOverride-18">God. Within the community, of course, it is the child’s parents and godparents who are specially called to share their faith with the child and to do all they can to encourage and support the child’s growth in faith. Parents and godparents are required to renew their </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">own</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> baptismal promises. They profess </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">their </span><span class="CharOverride-18">belief and commit themselves to being living examples of faith and leading their child into the mystery and wonder of God. It is through this relationship that one day a child might come to voice his or her own faith. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In the Gospels, there are a number of examples of Jesus responding to the faith of parents when petitioning on behalf of their children. When Jairus, the synagogue leader, asked Jesus to raise his young daughter from death to life (Mark 5:22-23, 35-43), and when another father asked Jesus to expel an evil spirit from his son (Mark 9:17-27), Jesus acted with power because of their faith, not the faith of their children.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Church believes that Christ responds in the same way when infants and children are baptised. For how much more would he not desire to free children from the far worse bondage of sin and eternal death, in response to the faith of their parents and of the whole Christian community?</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">But the Church also teaches that the parents of the baptised child must commit themselves to providing an environment for the child to grow in faith. This will prepare the child to make a personal commitment to Jesus Christ upon reaching maturity. Such a personal faith commitment is absolutely necessary for the mature Christian. One way the Church stresses the necessity for this commitment to the Lord is by calling on each person to renew his or her baptismal covenant every year at the Easter Liturgy.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Infant Baptism also underscores the fact that salvation is a free gift from God. When someone baptises, it is Christ who baptises. He is the one who saves. Infant Baptism reminds us that this salvation through baptism is not something the person could have earned or merited. It reminds us that the sacraments are primarily works of God, and that God’s initiative in our lives is most important. The infant did not choose to be baptised, but neither did he or she choose to be born. Both birth and Baptism are God’s gift, brought about through human agents: the children’s parents. Just as the parents cooperate in God’s plan by initiating their child’s physical life, they can also cooperate with God, through their faith, in initiating the child’s eternal, spiritual life by presenting the child to be baptised.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The fate of the unbaptised</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Finally, what of those who through no fault of theirs remain unbaptised? Scripture tells us that God wants everyone to be saved (1 Timothy 2:4). God offers salvation to every human being. It is quite wrong to think that a child who dies unbaptised will be excluded from the eternal joy of union with God. In 2007, the Church’s International Theological Commission published an important document on this subject and concluded that </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Christians dare to hope that God will embrace (unbaptised children) in his saving mercy. For we all live by faith and hope in the God of mercy and love.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Similarly those who out of ignorance do not come to know Christ, or have never heard the gospel preached, will not be refused the opportunity to be saved. We may not know how, but nor may we place restrictions on God’s infinite love and freedom.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The bishops at the Second Vatican Council stated this quite clearly in the Constitution on the Church, (no 16): </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Those who through no fault of their own, do not know the gospel of Christ or his Church, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and moved by grace, try in their actions to do God’s will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience – those too may achieve eternal salvation. Nor shall divine providence deny the assistance necessary to salvation to those who, without any fault of theirs, have not yet arrived at an explicit knowledge of God, and who, not without grace, strive to lead a good life.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">Confirmation</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Baptism is the first sacrament of initiation, not initiation into a club but a new beginning. There are three sacraments whereby a person is fully initiated into the Body of Christ; Baptism, Confirmation and Eucharist. The new Christian celebrates all three of these sacraments with the community at the Easter Vigil. This was the standard practice in the early centuries of Christianity. But in the Western Church, when entire communities had become Christian, and infant Baptism became the norm, it became the practice to delay Confirmation until the child was older. Both Confirmation and Eucharist became separate events to be celebrated later on, when the child had reached the so-called ‘age of reason’. It is interesting to note that in the Eastern Orthodox churches, infants are still confirmed and given the Eucharist on the occasion of their Baptism.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">As we have seen, the Holy Spirit is received at Baptism, and the baptised person becomes the dwelling place or ‘temple’ of the Spirit. When we speak of Confirmation as a fuller outpouring of the Spirit, it is not our intention to suggest that the Spirit is somehow divisible. Every sacrament is a sign from the one God of the continuing love that is given to us.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In the Western or Roman church, Confirmation came to be seen as the sacrament of Christian adulthood, or the sacrament which marks the transition from childhood to maturity. The sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation were still seen as closely associated in terms of purpose and meaning, although separated by many years.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">However, in recent decades there has been a strong move in the Church to restore the order of the sacraments of initiation – Baptism, Confirmation and Eucharist. Many parts of the Church throughout the world now celebrate Confirmation </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">prior</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> to receiving First Eucharist. The sacrament of Confirmation is properly connected to the sacrament of Baptism. Confirmation is the strengthening of the new life which began at the font. Many parents, educators and pastors would argue that there will still be a need for young Catholics to be given an opportunity to make a mature personal commitment to Christ when they become capable of it.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The biblical background</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Let us look at some of the biblical background to the Church’s sacrament of Confirmation. The Holy Spirit comes first to a person in Baptism (see Acts 2:38), but the book of Acts also mentions a prayer for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit accompanied by the external, visible sign of a ‘laying on of hands’. Later we read that Peter and John were sent to new converts in Samaria and </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit (for as yet the Spirit had not come upon any of them; they had only been baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus). Then Peter and John laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Acts 8:15-17).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Later again in Acts, Paul baptised some disciples in the name of the Lord Jesus, and then </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Acts 19:6). Some theologians think the reason why these people lacked the Holy Spirit was because they were initially baptised only in the name of Jesus, and not in the name of the </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Matthew 28:19).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Whatever about this theological opinion, the early Church came to recognise that there was a prayer for the sending of the Holy Spirit that was distinct from baptism. Christians often received the full outpouring of the Holy Spirit through the prayer and ‘laying on of hands’ of the apostles or their associates. </span><span class="CharOverride-18">Later an anointing with oil was added to the sacrament, and this is how the sacrament of Confirmation originated. The commitment to Christ was thus ‘confirmed’ or strengthened in the life of the baptised Christian.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The sacrament is also based on the life of Jesus, on whom the Holy Spirit descended when he began his public ministry (Mark 1:9-11), who breathed upon his disciples after his resurrection with the words, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">receive the Holy Spirit </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(John 20:22), and who sent the Holy Spirit upon them at Pentecost (Acts 2).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It was at Pentecost, according to the Book of Acts, that Jesus fulfilled his promise to send the Holy Spirit. Confirmation is to Baptism what Pentecost is to Easter. Just as Scripture draws a close connection between the resurrection of Jesus and the sending of the Spirit, so too the sacrament of Confirmation receives its proper emphasis when it is seen in close association with the sacrament of Baptism. The book of the Acts of the Apostles is really a record of the activity of the Holy Spirit from Pentecost on, guiding and directing the growth of the Church in its early years. The sacrament of Confirmation makes Pentecost a permanent event in the life of the Christian.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading ParaOverride-47">The gifts of the Spirit</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is the same gift of God’s love and life which the baptised person receives at Confirmation. The candidate renews his or her baptismal promises, and the bishop (or delegated priest) anoints the candidate on the forehead with fragrant Chrism (consecrated) oil, saying the words: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Be sealed with the gift of the Holy Spirit</span><span class="CharOverride-18">. To be ‘sealed’ means to be authoritatively marked or stamped as someone’s property. The oil is the sign of the strength which the sacrament gives. The ‘gift of the Holy Spirit’, a share in God’s life and love, is of course a single gift, but it will manifest itself in a multitude of ways. A traditional list of ‘gifts’ of the Spirit is taken from the prophecy of Isaiah (11:2-3), where the prophet numbers seven gifts. It should be remembered that the number seven in biblical symbolism stands for fullness, completeness and perfection. In the rite of Confirmation the bishop or his delegate prays that the candidates should receive </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and fortitude, the spirit of knowledge and piety; ... </span><span class="Italic CharOverride-18">[and] </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">the spirit of the fear of the Lord</span><span class="CharOverride-18">.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Paul also speaks of a number of effects of living by the Spirit: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Galatians 5:22-23). But ultimately there is no limit to these gifts or fruits, just as there is no limit to love. The way of life proposed by Christ for his followers is a life of unlimited generosity.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Call to service and witness</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Finally, through the sacrament of Confirmation, the Holy Spirit empowers God’s people to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ, to live that message, and to continue Jesus’ ministry and mission in the world. Just as the Spirit descended on Jesus at the beginning of his public ministry and transformed the fearful disciples at Pentecost, so the Spirit equips every Christian for a life of service and witness.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">To sum up, Christian initiation begins with Baptism, is sealed by Confirmation and is continued through the Eucharist. Baptism and Confirmation draw us into Christ’s life, and empower us to continue his saving work. They are signs that our lives have been radically influenced by Christ, and the demands they make as far as conversion (radical change) is concerned are constant. But these sacraments also assure us that we are never alone on our pilgrimage, and that God – Father, Son and Holy Spirit – is our constant companion. The whole of Christian life is not captured in singular sacramental moments but experienced and expressed throughout the life-long journey of deepening of our relationship with Jesus. Real Christian initiation continues throughout all the days of our life.</span></p>

			<p class="body ParaOverride-13"><span class="text-after-drop-cap CharOverride-18">     he Eucharist is</span><span class="CharOverride-18"><br />the </span><span class="CharOverride-18">sacrament which comes after Baptism and Confirmation as the climax of the process of initiation into the People of God, the Church. In the early centuries of the Church, new Christians after receiving Baptism were then confirmed or sealed by the Spirit, and in the course of the liturgy would proceed immediately to receive the Eucharist. They were thereby fully initiated into the Church, and were then able to share fully in the Church’s life and worship.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">As we explained in the previous chapter, it has become the Church’s practice to defer the celebration of the sacraments of Confirmation and Eucharist in the case of children. It had been the norm for children to receive the Eucharist some years before they were confirmed. In many parts of the Church throughout the world, the ancient order of Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist has been restored and is now the usual practice in many dioceses.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">‘Summit and fountain’</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">However, there is much more to the Eucharist than simply seeing it as the completion of the process of initiation. The Second Vatican Council described it as both the ‘summit’ and the ‘fountain’ of the whole of the Church’s life and activity. In describing the Eucharist as the ‘summit’ of the Church’s activity, the Council wanted to express primarily the Church’s belief that the Eucharist is the highest form of worship we can offer to God.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Why do people worship God? Sad to say there are those who worship God out of a sense of fear. ‘Fear of the Lord’ has its place in a person’s religious outlook, but it should never be the main motivation for worship. Others approach their worship in the spirit of paying a debt, and act out of a sense of obligation to God because of God’s gifts to them. This represents a definite advance on the fear motivation, but love must be the dominant attitude behind one’s desire to give thanks, not just a sense of duty. We should want to worship God because we want to respond to the great love shown for us, by expressing our love for God in the best possible way.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Eucharist enables us to do this. The word is of Greek origin, and has the meaning ‘to give thanks’. Our use of the word is derived from the description of the action of Jesus at the Last Supper who gave thanks to the Father before pronouncing over the bread and wine the words, This is my body ... this is my blood, and sharing them with his disciples.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Institution narrative</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">To understand the Eucharist properly we need to reflect on the significance of these words and actions of Jesus at his last meal with his disciples on the evening before his death. There are four accounts of this event which the Church identifies as the occasion when Jesus instituted the sacrament of the Eucharist.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The earliest account we have comes from Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians (11:23-26). Other versions are found in the first three Gospels (Mark 14:22-25; Matthew 26:26-29; Luke 22:14-20). Although there are slight variations in the different accounts of Jesus’ words, they are not significant. Luke describes it this way: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Then he took a loaf of bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, ‘This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.’ And he did the same with the cup after supper, saying, ‘This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood’</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (22:19-20).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">As with all the doctrines of the Church, it took some time for the significance of what Jesus said and did to be fully understood and appreciated by his followers. In each of the Gospel accounts there is a variation of a saying of Jesus which suggests that in the very beginning, what Jesus did was seen as an anticipation of the coming of the kingdom. The earliest Gospel, Mark, reports that immediately after speaking of his blood of the new covenant which was </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">poured out</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> for many, Jesus said to his disciples: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Truly I tell you, I will never again drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Mark 14:25; see also Matthew 26:29 and Luke 22:15-16).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Pledge of the Kingdom</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The coming reign of God’s love was on several occasions described by the Old Testament prophets in the imagery of a banquet, and wine was used as a symbol of the blessings which would flow in the messianic age. Paul also uses a phrase which connects the Eucharist with the return of Christ: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (1 Corinthians 11:26). </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">There is widespread evidence in the New Testament to indicate that the Christians of the first generation believed that Jesus would soon come again to establish the kingdom or reign of God in its perfect and complete form. It is quite understandable then that they would have seen the words and actions of Jesus at the Last Supper as the anticipation and pledge of the coming kingdom.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The word Eucharist was probably not used in the early days of Christianity. The book of Acts tells us that in the earliest period Jesus’ followers in Jerusalem would meet in one another’s homes, where: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Acts 2:42). The phrase breaking bread in their homes recurs in verse 46. Although this expression can mean simply ‘sharing a meal’, it seems certain that on some occasions at least, they included in their common meals a re-enactment of the words and actions of Jesus at the Last Supper. It is commonly thought that the phrase ‘the breaking of bread’ was an early Christian name for the Eucharist. It was also known as ‘the Lord’s Supper’, as we learn from Paul <br />(1 Corinthians 11:20).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Memorial meal</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Both Paul and Luke in their versions of the Last Supper note that Jesus added the words </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Do this in remembrance of me</span><span class="CharOverride-18">. This indicates that as well as understanding the Eucharist as an anticipation of the kingdom, the first followers of Jesus also emphasised the memorial aspect of the Lord’s Supper which they celebrated. To understand this fully, we need to reflect on the context in which Jesus instituted the Eucharist, especially the fact that he did so in the setting of the Jewish Passover meal.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Each year the Jews gathered together in family groups to recall how God had chosen them to be ‘God’s own people’, led them out of slavery in Egypt, and brought them to the promised land. In a spirit of love and gratitude, they remembered God’s many gifts and constant love throughout their history. At this Passover feast, they re-enacted in a prayerful way a living memorial of an event that had happened in past history, but whose blessings they still experienced in the present. Their celebration took place in the setting of a sacred meal, during which they ate from a lamb which had been sacrificed to God in the temple the previous afternoon. They sang psalms of praise to God for the gift of the Passover from slavery to the freedom of the promised land, and for the covenant which this loving God had made with them as God’s own people.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It was at a Passover meal that Jesus pronounced his words over the bread and wine, and inevitably his followers would have soon come to recognise in his words and actions his gift to them of a new living memorial of thanksgiving. By his words </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Do this in remembrance of me (Luke 22:19)</span><span class="CharOverride-18">, he offered to the first disciples and to all who would come after them the gift of sharing continually in this new memorial and of belonging to a new covenant with God, of which the blood of Jesus was the sign. (The Greek phrase translated as </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">in remembrance of is eis anamn</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">ē</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">sin. A slightly more accurate </span><span class="CharOverride-18">translation is: do this as a memorial of me. In the context of the Passover meal it has a significance that is both past, present and future – God’s covenant then, now and forever.)</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Eucharist as sacrifice</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">From the idea of memorial, it was a natural progression for the early Christians to come to an understanding of the Eucharist as a sacrifice. The connection between what Jesus said and did at the Last Supper and the sacrifice he made of himself the following afternoon was clear. After all, did he not speak of the bread as his body which was given for them, and of the wine as his blood which was poured out for them? The Eucharist was thus seen as the memorial of Jesus’ death. Paul said that eating the bread and drinking the cup were a proclamation of the Lord’s death. Earlier in the same letter (1 Corinthians 5:7) he had said </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">our paschal lamb, Christ, has been sacrificed</span><span class="CharOverride-18">. The followers of Jesus thus came to see that Jesus offered himself as the new lamb of sacrifice, and commanded them to do this in memory of him.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In line, therefore, with the Jewish understanding of the words ‘memory’ and ‘memorial’ we believe that Jesus did not just demand a simple recall of what he had done but a re-enactment. Just as he changed bread and wine into his Body and Blood, the Church believes that the disciples were empowered by him to do the same. Moreover it is Catholic belief that this power continues to reside in the Church, and that part of the spiritual power of the Church gathered at Eucharist is to call on the Holy Spirit to change the gifts of bread and the wine (along with ourselves) into the Body and Blood of Christ. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">For this reason, the Catholic tradition of Christianity has always insisted that the words of Jesus, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">This is my body ... this is my blood,</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> must be understood not just in a figurative sense (‘this signifies ...’) but in the sense that the bread and wine really become the Body and Blood of Christ in a sacramental way. This realistic understanding of Jesus’ words is confirmed by the famous sixth chapter of John’s Gospel, the last Gospel to be written, in the last decade of the first century. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">John chose not to describe the institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper, but gives a lengthy report of a discourse of Jesus after he had fed the 5,000 people with a few loaves and fishes. Jesus’ words as reported by John clearly show that John’s community at least firmly believed that the eucharistic bread and wine were truly the Body and Blood of Jesus.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The real presence</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">It also becomes clear in John’s account that Jesus’ teaching was a cause of scandal to the Jews and to others who were considering becoming his followers – perhaps even to other Jewish Christians of John’s time (late first century) who were unable to accept this exalted understanding of the Eucharist. According to John, Jesus spoke of the need to eat his flesh and drink his blood to gain eternal life (John 6:53-56), and predicted that many people would be scandalised and fall away from following him because of his teaching (6:60-64). This teaching is as much of a challenge to the faith of Christians today as it was to the readers of John’s Gospel then. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Catholic Christians accept this challenging teaching at its face value, and believe that when they receive the bread and wine of the Eucharist, they are actually partaking in the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. This always, of course, needs careful nuance to preserve the sacramental meaning behind the Church’s understanding. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This understanding is also affirmed by Paul who wrote in 1 Corinthians: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a sharing in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (1 Corinthians 10:16-17). Further on in this letter, after describing Jesus’ words and actions at the Last Supper, Paul concludes: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be answerable for the body and blood of the Lord</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (1 Corinthians 11:27). The most straightforward interpretation of these passages is that Paul considered the eucharistic bread and wine to be really the body and blood of Christ.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The ‘real presence’ of Jesus Christ in the bread and wine of the Eucharist is an important part of the Catholic tradition. It is also a central belief in the Eastern Orthodox churches, as well as the Anglican and Lutheran traditions. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In an ecumenical statement between the Catholic and Anglican churches, both traditions were able to hold this consensus: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">What is here affirmed is a sacramental presence in which God uses the realities of this world to convey the realities of the new creation: bread for this life becomes the bread of eternal life. Before the Eucharistic Prayer, to the question: ‘What is that?’, the believer answers: ‘It is bread’. After the Eucharistic Prayer, to the same question he answers: ‘It is truly the body of Christ, the Bread of Life’ ... The bread and wine become the sacramental body and blood of Christ in order that the Christian community may become more truly what it already is, the body of Christ.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This presence of Jesus can be accepted only in faith, since the outward appearance of the bread and wine does not change. Medieval Catholic theologians used the term ‘transubstantiation’ to describe the mystery that the inner reality (substance) of the bread and wine is transformed into the Body and Blood of Christ, while the outward appearance remains the same. This doctrine is not intended to explain how it happens, or to reduce this mystery of faith to magic. It simply affirms in faith that Jesus’ words are literally true: the bread and wine offered to God in the Eucharist become his Body and Blood. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This is why Catholics have great reverence for the eucharistic bread and wine. They do not worship ‘the host’ (the name given to the eucharistic bread), but worship Jesus Christ whom they discern by faith to be present there. Of course a ‘real sacramental’ presence must be distinguished from a ‘real physical’ presence. Christ is present truly but not ‘physically’ in the same way that a human being is present. Christ’s presence is mediated through sacramental symbols such as bread and wine. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is also important to remember that the Church teaches that in the Eucharistic gathering, Christ is present in four ways: in the gathered assembly, in the priest (who is Christ’s representative), in the word (the Scripture that is proclaimed), and most profoundly, in the Eucharistic elements of bread broken and wine poured out and shared. Properly understood, the real presence of Jesus Christ is not a scientific fact or philosophical position to be proven, but a real ‘person’ to be encountered.  </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">When we speak of the ‘real presence’ of Christ in the consecrated bread and wine, we affirm that the Eucharist is the supreme sign of God’s presence to us. We continually look for tangible signs of God, and although the whole of creation speaks of God’s presence, in this sacrament the search is on its way to completion, because the Eucharist is a real communion with God.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">A community event</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Eucharist is celebrated within the assembly of the Christian community. It is a community event. It is not a matter of a group of people coming together with nothing in common, but rather a group of baptised Christians who are part of the Church, the Body of Christ. The eucharistic celebration draws these people together into one assembly to worship God through, with and in the person of Jesus Christ. It is at this assembly that the Church becomes most visible as the worshipping Church, the Body of Christ here on earth.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It was no accident that Jesus chose the Passover meal as the occasion to institute the Eucharist. When people come together in trust and friendship, it is often in the context of a meal, and from the beginning the celebration of this sacrament was associated with a meal. Paul reminds the Corinthians of the love and sharing that should take place when they meet for a meal (1 Corinthians 11:33), but especially for the Meal, the Lord’s Supper (1 Corinthians 11:18-22). Luke tells us how the two disciples recognised Jesus after his resurrection at a meal, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">at the breaking of the bread</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Luke 24:30-31, 35). Our eucharistic celebration is also in the form of a meal. We prepare bread and wine and share that bread and wine among ourselves when it has become the Body and Blood of Christ.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Eucharist is a special kind of meal, a sacrificial meal. We share in the celebration of the Lord’s Supper which looks to the cross and draws the mystery of the cross into the celebration. We recall how when he instituted the Eucharist at the Passover meal, Jesus spoke of his body which would be ‘given’ and of his blood which would be ‘poured out’.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">An area of disagreement</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">To speak of the Eucharist as a sacrifice is a source of scandal for many Christians, who point out that the letter to the Hebrews states clearly that Jesus Christ has been sacrificed once for our sins, and now stands interceding for us in the presence of the Father (Hebrews 7:25; 9:24-28). However, the Church has never taught that Jesus is ‘re-sacrificed’ or offered up to suffer again. We call the Eucharist a sacrifice because we see it as ‘re-presenting’, i.e. presenting once again before us, the one sacrifice of Christ on Calvary.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Sacrifice is difficult terminology, particularly when we believe in a God of love and mercy. Sacrifice in the ordinary sense of the word tends to be understood as a ‘letting go’ or a ‘foregoing’ of time or money or what is rightly and fairly due. In a religious sense, it can be understood as a gesture or act to persuade or appease a divine being. However, a Christian sense of sacrifice has a much fuller and richer meaning. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">When we speak of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, we speak of more than just Jesus’ death on the cross. The full sacrifice of Jesus Christ is his self-giving to the Father for us which was made manifest in his birth, his life, his preaching, his miracles, his acts of love and justice which found their climactic expression in his death, resurrection and sending of the Spirit. The sacrifice of Christ is the total pouring out of his life for us. It is Jesus Christ’s gift of himself in response to the love of his Father. In the Holy Spirit, we too are drawn into this gift of life and love (sacrifice). We begin to ‘taste’ now the life of the Trinity. This gives us a ‘window’ or ‘fore-taste’ into the day when we will hopefully fully share in the ‘heavenly banquet’. Sacrifice in a Christian sense is not only an ‘emptying’, a ‘foregoing’, but also a ‘gifting’, a ‘birthing’ of new life. </span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-47"><span class="CharOverride-18">This once-and-for-all sacrifice of Christ is most clearly fulfilled on Calvary but this cannot be separated from the whole of Jesus’ earthly life. To say that Eucharist is a sacrifice is to say that in the Eucharistic celebration we encounter this self-giving of Jesus Christ. In God’s mercy, this same once-and-for-all sacrifice of Christ is made present to us through the Eucharist and we, the faithful, are made present to this gift of self-offering. The full meaning of the ‘sacrifice of the Mass’ can be seen in the words of the Third Eucharistic Prayer:</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-49"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">T</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">herefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the mem</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">orial </span></p>

			<p class="body ParaOverride-49"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Look, we pray, upon the oblation of your Church </span></p>

			<p class="body ParaOverride-51"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">may become one body, one spirit in Christ.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In the Eucharist, we call to mind, not only Jesus’ death, but also his resurrection, ascension and our expectation of his coming again. We ask God to look upon </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">our</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> prayer and gathering and ask the Father to ‘see’ and ‘recognise’ in our offering, his Son. Drawn into this relationship of Father and Son, we then ask that we may be even more deeply-filled with the Holy Spirit so that we might become ever-closer to Christ. The sacrifice of Jesus Christ changes us and brings us to new life. That is the ‘redemptive’ meaning and purpose of the sacrifice of Jesus. Our small and large efforts to live in love, justice and service are our participation in the loving sacrifice of Christ. Sacrificial love brings life to all relationships, and there is no better model of sacrificial love than the life, death and resurrection of Jesus. </span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Perfect love</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Through his death and resurrection, Christ bequeathed to his Church a perfect way of expressing love for the Father. In response to Jesus’ loving obedience even to death on the cross, God showed acceptance of Jesus’ sacrifice by exalting him (Philippians 2:8-9). Through the resurrection and exaltation of Jesus, his offering became our offering. Every time we share in the living memorial of Christ’s passion, death and resurrection, which is the Eucharist, we, the Church, worship God and express our love in the most perfect way possible for human beings.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Because the Eucharist or Lord’s Supper makes present the central mystery of the Christian faith – the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ – Catholics consider it the highest form of prayer and worship. Believers have a need and desire to express their love for God. Once aware of God’s infinite love for them, they naturally want to respond. To enable us to do so in an appropriate and satisfying way, God has once more shown us love by giving us the means to satisfy our desire. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Through the sacraments of initiation, Baptism, Confirmation and the Eucharist, we are grafted into Christ and empowered to join with him in calling God our Father. Through these sacraments, and especially the Eucharist, the bonds of our unity (communion) within God’s family are reinforced and we can express our love for God in a way that </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the human heart conceived</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (1 Corinthians 2:9).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The prayer of the Church</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Eucharist is not just the prayer of the individual, nor of the priest who presides over it, but is truly the prayer of the whole Church gathered to worship God through Jesus, our saviour and great high priest (Hebrews 7:26; 8:1). The Second Vatican Council’s </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(no 10) affirms this when it says that </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">the </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">liturgy (the Mass) is the summit towards which the activity of the Church is directed; at the same time it is the fountain from which all her power flows. For the goal of apostolic works is that all who are made children of God by faith and baptism should come together to praise God in the midst of the Church, to take part in her sacrifice, and to eat the Lord’s Supper.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">All the power of the Church flows from the life, death and resurrection of Jesus. All the Church’s many activities are brought together and offered to God as a sacrifice of praise in the liturgy of the Mass. The Mass reminds us that all gifts and power in the Church come from God and that the purpose of our lives is to worship God, to be nourished by God, and to offer all that we do back to God as a pleasing sacrifice by uniting it with the one truly acceptable sacrifice, the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.</span></p>

Their re-enactment of the Last Supper was accompanied by readings from the Scriptures, prayer and reflection on the life and teaching of Jesus. Many early Christian writings record these various readings and prayers. This ‘prayer service’ with the Eucharist as its centre came in time to be called the Mass. Although the Mass has undergone development over the centuries, its parts are essentially the same as the worship services of the early church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Very early in the life of the Church, the first day of the week (Sunday), the day of Jesus’ resurrection, was designated as the principal occasion for the celebration of the Lord’s Supper or Eucharist. It was generally assumed that all Christians who were physically able would gather on this day to worship the Lord and partake of his body and blood. In the letter to the Hebrews (10:25), there is a warning against </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some. </span><span class="CharOverride-18">The Church follows this practice of requiring its members to worship together on Sunday as a community and to praise God for all the gifts that have flowed from the Son’s death and resurrection.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is not clear from the Bible who presided over the Eucharist or Lord’s Supper in the first century, but in the early second century St Ignatius of Antioch stated that only the bishop or his appointed representatives could lead the community in the celebration of the Eucharist. This became the accepted pattern: bishops were the primary leaders of the official worship of the Christian community, and they appointed priests to assist them when their ‘flocks’ became too large for one man’s sacramental ministry. Today the Church carries on this ancient practice of having only bishops and the priests they appoint preside over the Eucharist. This is part of the doctrine of ‘apostolic succession’, which states that the bishops are the ones who succeed to the ministry and leadership of the apostles, to whom Jesus gave the direct commission: ‘Do this in memory of me’.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Writing a few decades after St Ignatius, St Justin Martyr provides a description of these early church celebrations: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">On the day called Sunday there is a meeting in one place of those who live in cities or the country, and the memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read as long as time permits</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Liturgy of the Word). </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">When the reader has finished, the president in a discourse urges and invites us to the imitation of these noble things</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (homily). </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Then we all stand up together and offer prayers</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (intercessions). </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">And when we have finished the prayer, bread is brought, and the wine and water, and the president similarly sends up prayers and thanksgivings to the best of his ability, and the congregation assents, saying Amen </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Liturgy of the Eucharist);</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18"> the distribution and reception of the consecrated elements by each one takes place</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Communion) </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">and they are sent to the absent by the deacons</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Dismissal). We can see that the basic liturgical pattern remains the same today.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Introductory Rites</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The first part of the Mass begins with a short period of preparation. The assembly sings an entrance song or recites an entrance antiphon as the priest approaches the altar. The priest greets the people and invites them to prepare themselves for the celebration by reflecting on their sinfulness and asking for God’s forgiveness. Usually this is followed by a prayer of glory or praise of God (Gloria). The priest then invites the assembly to pray in silence, then collects the people’s prayers together in the Collect specially chosen for the day. Through these introductory rites, the people deepen their experience of community and are now prepared to hear God’s word.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">Liturgy of the Word</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">In the first of the two main parts of the Mass or Eucharistic celebration, the assembly which has come together in faith and love celebrates the Liturgy of the Word. God’s people listen to the word of God proclaimed at the ambo. The word reveals God’s hopes and dreams for all of humankind. Through the Liturgy of the Word, they come to know God more intimately.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Readings</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The main part of the Liturgy of the Word consists of readings from the Scriptures. On Sundays and special feast days, three readings are chosen. Normally the first reading is from the Old Testament. During the Easter season (Easter to Pentecost) it is from the Acts of the Apostles. This is followed by a psalm which is usually sung. As a second reading, the Church selects a passage from one of the New Testament letters. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">A third reading, the most sacred of all, comes from the Gospels, during which all stand as a mark of respect. On weekdays, two readings only (including an extract from the Gospels) are proclaimed. Through these passages from the Scriptures, we are helped to come to know God and to understand God’s message more fully. The readings have been chosen so that a large part of Scripture is read over a three year cycle. The book from which the readings are read is called the Lectionary.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Homily</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The readings are followed by the homily, which is a Greek word that means ‘conversation’. It is an important part of the Liturgy of the Word, in which the priest celebrant explains their meaning and applies their message to Christian living in today’s world. It is a form of ‘conversation’ between the readings of Scripture and the circumstances of our lives. Ideally, a short period of silent reflection should follow the homily.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Creed</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">On Sundays and special occasions, the assembly now makes a profession of faith, an ancient formula of faith which came out of the Councils of Nicea and Constantinople in the fourth century. There follows a series of general intercessions or the prayer of the faithful, now known as the Universal Prayer, in which the assembly prays for the needs of the Church and people throughout the world.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">Liturgy of THE Eucharist</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">After listening to God’s word and reflecting on it, the community now prepares to celebrate the Liturgy of the Eucharist, the second main part of the Mass. Representatives from among the people bring to the altar gifts of bread and wine. The altar is a symbol of Christ, and the bread and wine placed on the altar will, in the course of the Eucharist, become Christ himself.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Eucharistic Prayer</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Eucharistic prayer proper begins with a prayer of thanksgiving, called the Preface, in which the priest thanks God for the blessings given through Jesus Christ and prays that the whole world may continually proclaim the glory of God. The assembly responds to this prayer with an acclamation taken from the prophet Isaiah: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Holy, holy, holy ... </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In the course of the Eucharistic prayer, the priest calls upon the Holy Spirit praying that the bread and wine will be changed into the Body and Blood of Christ by the power of the Spirit. In the Institution Narrative the priest pronounces the words, ‘For this is my body’, over the bread, and ‘This is the chalice of my blood’, over the wine. The repetition of Jesus’ words </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">do this in remembrance of me,</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> reminds us that what took place at the Last Supper now takes place at the altar, and that Jesus becomes sacramentally, but really, present.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">After this ‘Institution Narrative (Consecration)’ of the bread and wine, the assembly proclaims its faith in the Paschal Mystery – the life, death, resurrection and return of Jesus Christ in glory. The Church then proceeds to pray for the Pope, bishops, priests, and all the living and the dead. Mary, the mother of Jesus, is mentioned as a sign of the special place of honour in which the Church holds her.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Great Amen</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Eucharistic prayer ends with the priest holding up the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ to the people and praising the Father. To this prayer of praise the assembly replies with the ‘Great Amen’, which expresses its belief in, and acceptance of, Christ’s Eucharistic gift.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Communion Rite</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Through Baptism, we become children of God and are able to address God with the familiarity yet respect of a child to a parent. To show this intimacy with God and our unity in worship, we join in addressing God as our Father. After a short prayer for peace, the people are invited to exchange a greeting of peace with one another – a sign of reconciliation and unity. This greeting of peace flows on from the Lord’s Prayer, in which we ask for God’s forgiveness and promise to forgive those who have offended us.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Holy Communion</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">This sign of peace and reconciliation and unity is an excellent preparation for receiving Holy Communion. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The priest breaks the bread, recalling the action of Jesus and the fact that he himself was broken. The sign of the sacrament is more fully shown, if the whole assembly or a significant part of it receives the Body of Christ from the one ‘bread’: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">The bread that we break, is it not a sharing in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (1 Corinthians 10:16-17).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Similarly the sign is best expressed if the people receive the sacrament under the forms of both consecrated bread and wine. However if the Eucharist is received under either form of bread or wine, the people still share in the whole person of Christ. This part of the liturgy concludes with a prayer asking God’s blessing on those who have shared in the banquet of the Lord.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Concluding Rites</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Then follows the dismissal. The priest blesses the community in the name of the Father, the Son and Holy Spirit, and urges them to go in peace to share with others the love and service celebrated in the Eucharist. With the words, ‘Thanks be to God’, the people express their final, grateful response, and the Eucharistic liturgy is ended.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">Respect for the Eucharist</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">There are certain rules and regulations concerning our celebration of the Eucharist. First, the Church teaches that Catholics who are conscious of serious sin (i.e. a grave matter) should refrain from receiving the Eucharist. Although no one is without sin and the Eucharist itself is a channel of God’s forgiveness, a person whose life is a contradiction of the gospel (i.e. in a state of mortal sin) may not receive the sacrament without first being reconciled through the sacrament of Penance, which we will consider in the next chapter. For lesser sins, the penitential act, if entered into in the spirit of conversion, serves to enable us to be ready.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Eucharistic hospitality</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Moreover, only those who are members of the Catholic Church are allowed to receive Communion, although there are some exceptions to the general rule. The Eucharist is meant to be a visible sign of the unity of God’s people in Jesus Christ. Paul stresses this aspect of the Eucharist in the passage from 1 Corinthians already quoted where he speaks of all who are one body participating in the Body of Christ.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The sad reality is that the Body of Christ today is not one, but is divided into many churches and communities who disagree on many important issues. One of those divisive issues is whether the bread and wine offered at the Eucharist really becomes the body and blood of Christ. Christians also disagree about who has the proper authority to preside at the Eucharistic celebration.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Catholic Church considers these disagreements and divisions so serious that except in special circumstances, it does not permit its members to receive communion in other Christian churches, nor allow other Christians to receive the Eucharist in the Catholic Church until these differences are resolved. Catholics believe that in the Eucharist they are truly receiving the body and blood of Jesus Christ, and that their reception of the Eucharist expresses their communion or unity with the whole Church. They also believe that only their bishops and the priests they ordain have the authority, stemming from Jesus’ commissioning of his disciples at the Last Supper, to preside over the Eucharistic celebration.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Church has decreed that its members cannot in good conscience join with other Christians in this ‘sacrament of unity’, while there remains a basic disunity and disagreement with them about the Eucharist itself and other important points of Christian faith. It is the Church’s view that participation in the Eucharist is primarily the ultimate sign of the unity that exists among Christians rather than a means for achieving unity. We realise other Christians do not share this perspective, but we ask them to respect this understanding of intercommunion when they attend a Catholic service, just as we should respect the beliefs of those who have a different point of view.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus said: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">So when you are offering your gift at the altar, if you remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother or sister, and then come and offer your gift</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Matthew 5:23-24). Catholics should earnestly wish to seek reconciliation with other Christians, both as Churches and individuals, so that we will be able to approach the altar of God together in genuine unity of mind and heart. Until the day when the Lord heals the present disunity, the pain of the divisions that prevent Catholics from sharing the Lord’s Supper with other Christians serves as a strong motivation for us to pray and work (in ecumenical endeavours) for the unity of God’s people.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">There are other Church regulations to the effect that a person should fast from food and drink (excluding water and medications/medicine) for one hour before receiving Holy Communion. This rule aims to promote greater respect for the Eucharist. Moreover, it is a law of the Church that a Catholic must receive Communion at least once during the Easter season each year. Such an obligation is of course completely unnecessary for those who appreciate the value and privilege of celebrating the reception of Christ in the Eucharist. It is a relic of the times when, because of a misguided respect (people thought they were not worthy), people received the Eucharist very rarely.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Eucharistic devotion</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The consecrated bread which is left after the celebration of the Eucharist is placed by the priest in a special repository called a tabernacle, sometimes located in a separate Eucharistic chapel. Catholics believe that Christ remains present under the form of the Eucharistic bread even after the Mass is over. For this reason they regard the Eucharist chapel (i.e. Blessed Sacrament Chapel), or tabernacle, as a sacred place. This is why Catholics on entering the Church, or when passing in front of the tabernacle genuflect on one knee, as an act of reverence for the Eucharistic presence of Christ.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">From the tabernacle, where the consecrated bread is stored, the Eucharist is taken to the sick in homes or hospitals by the priest or a special minister. Sometimes too, the Eucharistic bread, the Body of Christ, is displayed before the people to be worshipped in a ceremony which is called ‘Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament’. Terms such as Veneration, Adoration and Benediction describe various forms of quiet communal prayer outside of Mass. ‘Benediction’ or blessing, refers to the praise or blessing given to God through the Eucharistic presence of Jesus, God’s Son. </span></p>

It is as though ‘nothing seems to be a sin anymore’. The complaint is heard that so much emphasis is placed on God’s love and forgiveness that the gravity of sin tends to be played down. If God is so loving and forgiving, does it really matter how we behave? This argument reflects a misunderstanding of the nature of the relationship between God and ourselves. Certainly we must trust in God’s forgiveness, but we must not presume on it or take it for granted.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">For sin certainly does exist. It’s a reality which causes us to become estranged and alienated from God. It is in fact much more prevalent than most people are aware of. If we see sin only in terms of actions done in violation of particular laws, we can fail to recognise many omissions, failures to act, attitudes and prejudices which fall into the category of sin. Particular actions can be, and often are, sinful, but sin is primarily a matter of values and attitudes. Jesus himself, in the Sermon on the Mount and elsewhere, emphasised internal dispositions. Sinful actions are the external expression of the sinful condition which resides in a person’s heart.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">When Jesus was asked to nominate the most important of the commandments, he did not single out any one of the ten but replied: ‘</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the greatest and first commandment. And a second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbour as yourself.’ On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Matthew 22:37-40).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">If the whole law of God, all the commandments, depends on this double commandment of love – love of God and of neighbour – then it follows that sin is basically a lack of love. Just as love expresses itself in many ways, by the observance of the particular commandments of God, so sin is displayed in many forms, by the violation of specific commandments. But ultimately sin consists in the refusal or failure to love God and one’s neighbour. With this view of sin, our actions are sinful when they flow from an unloving heart.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">A forgiving heart</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">One of the most beautiful experiences we can have is that of being forgiven. The way to forgiveness can be hard and even painful, but it is worth it all to know that despite our faults we are still loved. Forgiveness is the reassurance that those we have offended still love us.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It does not have to mean that the past is forgotten or that the wrong we have done no longer matters. Our past sins are all part of the tapestry of who we are, but forgiveness makes it possible for us to weave them all into this tapestry without fear, so that we can be at peace again with ourselves, our fellow men and women, and our God. That is the meaning of reconciliation.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Bible teaches us that God can and will forgive any sin – no matter how serious – as long as we are truly repentant. The story of David and Bathsheba (2 Samuel chapters 11-12) is a graphic account of serious sin, repentance, forgiveness, and of God’s attitude to the sinner. God never refuses love to anyone. When we are truly sorry for our sins and turn to God, we become aware of God’s love and know that we are forgiven.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Still in the Old Testament, we hear God speaking through the prophet Isaiah: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be like snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Isaiah 1:18) and again: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Can a woman forget her nursing-child, or show no compassion for the child of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Isaiah 49:15). God promises the people never to forget them, and reminds them that God loves them as a good and loving parent and has always</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18"> led them with cords of human kindness, with bands of love</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Hosea 11:4). </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Return to the Lord, your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love, and relents from punishing</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Joel 2:13).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus: sign of forgiveness</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">This divine forgiving attitude stands out most clearly in the words and actions of Jesus. His whole mission was to set people free from their sins so that they could enjoy the freedom of living as children of God. He healed people of their physical and spiritual ailments. To the paralysed man who was brought to him, he said </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Your sins are forgiven ... Stand up and take your mat and walk</span><span class="CharOverride-18">. His claim to have the authority to forgive sins scandalised some people: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Why does this fellow speak in this way? It is blasphemy! Who can forgive sins but God alone</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (see Mark 2:1-12).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">When a woman who was a sinner anointed Jesus’ feet during a meal, he said to those who took offence: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">I tell you, her sins, which were many, have been forgiven; hence she has shown great love</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (see Luke 7:36-50). When he was accused of associating with sinners, he addressed to his critics the parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the lost (or ‘prodigal’) son (Luke 15:1-32). These stories make the point that God takes delight in forgiving, and is always ready to extend a warm welcome home to one who has strayed.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">From the parable of the prodigal son – better identified as the story of the prodigal father (prodigal: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">prodigious</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> or lavish in his forgiveness) – we learn an important lesson about God’s character. The son cut himself off from his father, but was never disowned by him. Nor did the father impose any conditions on his son’s return. When the son attempted to make his prepared speech about how badly he had behaved, his father interrupted him and told everyone to get ready for a feast, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">for this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Luke 15:24).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The need to be forgiven and freed from guilt is a basic human need. That is why it is so important to be aware of God’s attitude to those who have sinned, and to realise that the road back to God is always open. The road to be taken is the same as in Christ’s day: he is the way to the Father; he is still the one who heals and forgives; his work continues through the Church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">We have seen in a previous chapter that the Church is the sacrament of Christ, empowered by the Spirit to carry on his presence and saving activity in the world, especially through the individual sacraments. Since forgiveness and healing were so dominant in the ministry of Jesus, it would be strange if the Church did not make provision for a special sacrament which would continue his forgiving activity. It is the sacrament of Penance or Reconciliation which shows most clearly the continuation of Christ’s spiritual healing and forgiveness.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">The history of <br />the sacrament</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">This sacrament has a sound basis in the Gospel accounts of Jesus’ ministry. There is evidence to show that Jesus intended that his closest disciples, the Twelve, should have the same authority to forgive sins as he had himself. To Peter, the leader of the Twelve, Jesus said: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Matthew 16:19). The same words are addressed to all of the Twelve in Matthew 18:18. Even more directly, at the end of John’s Gospel, the risen Christ appeared to the Eleven and said: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (John 20:22-23).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This follows a pattern that is consistent throughout the Gospel. Jesus had special authority from his Father to establish the kingdom or reign of God. The Church is founded on the belief that Jesus passed on this authority to his leading disciples so that they could continue his ministry and mission after his departure. He gave them the Holy Spirit as the source of their authority to forgive sins in his name. It is true that Jesus commanded all of his followers to forgive one another (Matthew 6:14; 18:21-23; Luke 17:3-4), but Jesus also gave his leading disciples a special authority to ‘bind and loose’, and to forgive sins in God’s name.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Early understandings</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Church has from its early years worked on the principle that the original leaders of the Christian community passed on their authority to forgive sins to those who succeeded them. Over the centuries, there has been a development in the way the Church has celebrated this sacrament of forgiveness. In earlier times, formal forgiveness for sin, or absolution, was reserved only for those who had committed very serious public sins like murder, adultery or apostasy. It was accompanied by a long period of severe public penance, and could normally be received only once in a lifetime.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The early Christians took seriously the teaching of Paul about becoming a ‘new creation’ at baptism. It was expected that a baptised person had the grace to avoid serious sin, and because formal forgiveness of serious sin was restricted and involved serious penances, many converts to Christianity began to delay being baptised until late in life. They feared falling into serious sin after baptism, and enduring the public penances which were imposed.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">A change in the understanding of the sacrament came about in the sixth and seventh centuries. The Irish monks at the time were mainly responsible for this change. They developed the practice of forgiving sins in Jesus’ name as part of a more frequent private confession which included less serious sins. It became available to anyone who requested it, as often as seemed desirable. This eventually became the standard form of the sacrament, although in more recent times, the way in which the sacrament is celebrated has been modified to make it more helpful and fruitful for those who take part.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">A reconciling community</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Church which is the sacrament of Christ is called to carry on his ministry and mission to the world. It is to be the sign of his love, and this automatically includes his willingness to forgive. The Church is therefore by its very nature a reconciling community. It exercises this ministry, not just at Baptism, but subsequently as well, when members of the community, through human weakness, fail to live up to their baptismal commitment. Reconciliation enables us to make a new beginning. It is therefore the obligation of the community, as the sacrament of Christ, to exercise this ministry of reconciliation in a way that assures sinners they are always welcomed home.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Within this community context, the special sacrament of forgiveness is now often referred to as a Rite of Reconciliation. This change of name puts the emphasis differently – on the action of Christ who acts through the Church, and in particular, through his minister, the priest. Instead of penance or confession – terms which describe important actions and attitudes of the penitent – reconciliation stresses the saving work of Christ who reconciles sinners to God and to the believing community.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">Celebrating the sacrament</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">In the celebration of the sacrament of Penance or Reconciliation the first step is the most difficult part of the process, namely, the admission of one’s sinfulness. Such was the confession of the prodigal son: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Luke 15:21).</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-52"><span class="CharOverride-18">Before approaching the sacrament, the penitent should examine his or her conscience (there are many examples of examinations of conscience available to help guide our personal reflection) and pray for God’s forgiveness. The actual confession is made to the priest who is both the minister of Christ and the official representative of the community. After the opening sign of the cross, made by both priest and penitent, the priest greets the penitent and perhaps suggests a short passage from Scripture to be read. The penitent may also choose the Scripture passage. Although this is an optional part of the sacrament, it is a very helpful practice.</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-30"><span class="SACRAMENTS-IN-TEXT CharOverride-18">Confession.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> The penitent makes his or her confession to the best of his/her ability. To confess means more than to give a list of sins. It is more useful to reveal one’s difficulties and failures, one’s spiritual growth or lack of growth, one’s temptations and the helps and graces one hopes for. This helps the penitent to come to a better self-knowledge which is essential for growth. It also gives the priest a better chance to offer useful advice.</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-30"><span class="SACRAMENTS-IN-TEXT CharOverride-18">Contrition. </span><span class="CharOverride-18">This confession must be accompanied by true contrition or sorrow, not just remorse or self-pity from self-inflicted misery, but a genuine sorrow that God’s law has been broken and that harm has been done to oneself or others. The sinner turns back to God, seeking forgiveness and healing, and God, who delights in welcoming back the repentant sinner, provides the grace and strength needed to change. This resolution to re-direct one’s life, with the help of God, is a necessary component of true sorrow. It is a sign of the sincerity of one’s repentance.</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-30"><span class="SACRAMENTS-IN-TEXT CharOverride-18">Penance. </span><span class="CharOverride-18">Another integral part of the sacrament of Reconciliation is the ‘penance’ to be said or done afterwards. Our penance is not something whereby we ‘make up’ to God for sin, but an expression of our resolution to change our lives, especially in the area in which we have sinned. Each penance undertaken is a healing agent for one’s particular needs and weaknesses. It may take the form of prayer, or some act of charity or kindness towards others, especially towards anyone who has been more directly affected by one’s sin.</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-54"><span class="SACRAMENTS-IN-TEXT CharOverride-18">Absolution.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> Finally, after a prayer of sorrow said by the penitent, the priest pronounces the words of absolution. The priest, as representative of Christ and the Church, extends his hands over the head of the penitent and gives absolution with the words: </span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-55"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">... through the ministry of the Church,</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-55"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">may God give you pardon and peace, </span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-55"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">and I absolve you from your sins</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-55"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">in the name of the Father and of the Son</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-56"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">and of the Holy Spirit.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> </span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-13"><span class="CharOverride-18">The priest then dismisses the penitent with a word of encouragement such as: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">The Lord has freed you from sin. Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The three rites</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">There are three ways in which the sacrament of Reconciliation or Penance may be celebrated. The first way (or first rite) is alone with a priest, as we have described it. It involves a personal confession and individual absolution. This can be done either anonymously behind a screen or by face to face contact with the priest. It is left to the penitent’s preference.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The second way (or second rite) to celebrate the sacrament is to take part in a communal penitential service, with prayer, readings and examination of conscience, and then to make a personal confession and receive absolution from one of the priests present. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The third way (or third rite) is to take part in a penitential service in which there is a form of general confession and of general absolution, without making a private confession. In recent years, use of this form has been restricted and is now only available by the authority of the local bishop in the case of the ‘gravest necessity’. A grave necessity would include serious imminent danger or life-threatening situations. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">A communal celebration of reconciliation highlights the fact that we belong to a community, and emphasises the communal nature of sin and reconciliation. If one part of the body is hurt, the whole body is hurt (see 1 Corinthians 12:26).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Both in the private and the communal celebration of the sacrament, the penitent acknowledges that his or her sin has hurt the community. Just as love builds up the community, so sin tends to destroy it or tear it down. But the priest, as minister of the Church, and the people assembled together are saying to the penitent and to one another: You are being offered the forgiveness of Christ, who calls us all to be one in him. This is reconciliation, turning away from sin and turning to God, at the same time rejoining the community or joining it with greater love.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Sin and confession</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Church has always distinguished between different categories of sins, according to their gravity. If someone lives or acts in such a way as to cut himself/herself off completely from God and the Church, he/she is said to be in a state of serious sin. This is often called mortal sin, because it kills the divine life within us, and drives God’s grace-presence from us: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">sin, when it is full grown, brings birth to death</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (James 1:15). The person in such a state has either explicitly or implicitly chosen freely, deliberately and knowingly to reject God.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Even though forgiveness will always follow sincere sorrow, the Church still requires that all who are conscious of being or having been in such a condition should be reconciled with God and the community through the sacrament of Reconciliation, before partaking of the Eucharist. Only when it is physically or morally impossible to avail oneself of the sacrament should one feel exempt from this requirement.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is also a law of the Church that those who are conscious of being in a state of serious sin should receive the sacrament of Reconciliation at least once a year, between the beginning of Lent and the Sunday after Pentecost. This rule exists because of the obligation on all Catholics to receive the Eucharist during this same period of time. But apart altogether from the law, there is great value in the regular celebration of the sacrament. We need to acknowledge frequently, if we are to grow spiritually: that we are sinners who need a sign of forgiveness; that we belong to a community which we have harmed by our sins and which therefore should have some part in our healing; that we need to declare ourselves publicly as followers of Jesus Christ and to share in his healing work; and that we need the assurance of God’s constant love despite our sinfulness.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The need for a sacrament</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par ParaOverride-52"><span class="CharOverride-18">A basic question which is often asked concerns the necessity of this sacrament. Why not confess our sins directly to God? Why go through a priest or any human being? The answer to this question is already contained in what has been said earlier, but perhaps three points might be emphasised by way of summary:</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-57"><span class="CharOverride-18">1.&#9;It is appropriate and even necessary to repent directly before God for one’s sins. When Catholics participate in this sacrament, they are in fact expressing their repentance to God and seeking to be reconciled to God. However, it is also part of Catholic belief that there is a divine purpose behind the giving to particular persons in the community the authority to forgive sins in God’s name. It is another aspect of God’s ‘incarnational’ way of relating to human beings: using people to continue the divine work on earth is part of the way God works. When our sins are forgiven by one who has been set apart by the Church to represent Jesus Christ, we experience the mercy of Jesus himself through that person.</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-57"><span class="CharOverride-18">2.&#9;The confession of sins to a person reminds us of the social dimension of sin. When someone sins, the sin not only offends God, but it also has an effect, either directly or indirectly, on other people. The priest who grants God’s forgiveness not only represents Jesus Christ, but also the whole Christian community, the Church. The priest therefore has the authority to reconcile a sinner to the Church, the Body of Christ.</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-57"><span class="CharOverride-18">3.&#9;The priest is often able to counsel and encourage the penitent, or even pray with the penitent for the healing of some area of brokenness in the person’s life. Jesus often uses his representative, the priest, to minister to people’s needs in remarkable ways through the sacrament of Reconciliation.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Finally, like all the sacraments, the sacrament of Penance or Reconciliation is an act of worship in which we praise God. In this particular sacrament, we praise God for great mercy. It is surely the most natural thing for the reconciled sinner to do. The whole family or community has cause to celebrate. What we were or did no longer isolates us; instead of shame and guilt and scandal, there is only joy, peace and the experience that we are loved by God and the community.</span></p>

Paul reminds us that when one member of the Body of Christ suffers, all members share that suffering. All are called to treat the sick with kindness and love, recognising their union in Christ with the suffering member. Moreover, it is good to realise that in the very act of friendship there is already a healing in process. Perhaps only a few people have the actual gift of healing, but everyone can contribute in some way to the healing of the sick.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Comforting the sick</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The family and friends of the sick, as well as those who care for the sick, have a special share in the ministry of comfort. They should see themselves as the Church present and caring for those close to them. They have the responsibility and the power to strengthen the sick by their very presence, as well as by comforting them and praying with them. In the case of sickness which keeps a person bedridden or at home for some period of time, the family should consult the priest or a parish minister so that a designated parishioner can visit the sick person and see that Holy Communion is brought to him or her.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Visitation and care of the sick is an important pastoral duty of the priest and parish community. The parish community is representative of the broader concerned Church. Priest and lay people alike should reach out in love to suffering members of the community and to their families, not least by prayer. Visiting the sick is one of the works of mercy mentioned by Jesus in his portrait of the last judgement, and is identified with a work of mercy done to himself (Matthew 25:31-46).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In case of serious illness, the family should call the priest to celebrate the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick. We read throughout the Gospels of Jesus’ passionate concern not only for the spiritually ill or sinners, but for the physically sick and the dying. Numerous reports of his healing miracles testify to this concern, a concern which continues through the Church in the sacrament of Anointing.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Through this sacrament, the Church communicates to the sick person a new strength to bear suffering bravely and even to overcome it. The sacrament ministers to the whole person. While physical health may be restored as a result of the sacrament of Anointing, the true grace of the sacrament works at the spiritual level and raises up the sick in hope and peace. </span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Anointing in the Scriptures</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The biblical roots of the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick are very clear. As well as healing the sick, Jesus commanded and empowered his disciples to do the same. Mark’s Gospel describes Jesus sending the Twelve on a missionary tour, during which they</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18"> anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Mark 6:13). In the early Church, the letter of James tells us that this practice was continued: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Are any among you sick? They should call for the elders of the church and have them pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord. The prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise them up; and anyone who has committed sins will be forgiven.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (James 5:14-15)</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">A renewed focus</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">This sacrament has therefore been practised since the earliest days of the Church, but its focus has shifted at times. Prior to the renewal of the liturgy since the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), the emphasis was on preparation for death, and it was referred to as ‘Extreme Unction’ (the Last Anointing) or ‘The Last Rites’. However, the Council restored an emphasis on prayer for physical and spiritual healing for all seriously ill persons. The sacrament should not be deferred until the person is dangerously ill and on the point of death. Elderly people in a weak condition may be anointed, even though there is no question of any danger of death. The power of the sacrament to restore bodily as well as spiritual health is sufficient reason for its not being delayed. Moreover, there is no reason why a person may not receive this sacrament a number of times in the course of his or her lifetime, as often as it is judged to be called for. The sacrament of Anointing may also be celebrated as part of a Eucharistic celebration.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The sacrament does not guarantee that every sick person will be physically healed. Often God will work on a deeper level in the person. Colossians 1:24, and other New Testament texts urge Christians to accept and even rejoice in their sufferings, and to consider them a sharing in the suffering of Christ. Nevertheless, our God is a healing God who often responds to the prayer of Christians and works through the sacrament to restore to health those who are suffering.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The sacrament may be validly given to people who have lost consciousness or the use of reason. However, the proper sacrament of the dying is called ‘Viaticum’. This Latin term means ‘provisions or food for the journey’ – the journey over the waters of death into the life of God. Viaticum is the last sacrament of Christian life and involves the reception of the Body and/or the Blood of Christ, either in the context of Mass or outside Mass. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This celebration reveals that the sick person is sharing in a special way in the mystery of the death of the Lord and his return to the Father. It reminds us of the words of Jesus: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(John 6:54)</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">. </span><span class="CharOverride-18">If the celebration of Viaticum is not possible, there is also provision for Prayers for the Dying which are said as the seriously-ill person enters the final moments of life. In the case where a priest is called to a person who has already died, he will not administer the sacrament because sacraments can only be received by the living. In this case, the priest or deacon will offer prayers for God’s forgiveness and for the reception of the person into the kingdom of heaven. If there is doubt about whether or not the person is already dead, the priest may administer the sacrament conditionally. </span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">Celebrating the sacrament</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par ParaOverride-5"><span class="CharOverride-18">The sign of the sacrament is the laying of hands on the head of the sick person followed by anointing on the forehead and hands with oil. This anointing is accompanied by the words: </span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par ParaOverride-55"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Through this holy anointing </span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par ParaOverride-55"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">may the Lord in his love and mercy help you</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par ParaOverride-56"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">with the grace of the Holy Spirit. </span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par ParaOverride-55"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">May the Lord who frees you from sin </span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par ParaOverride-56"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">save you and raise you up.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The actual celebration of the sacrament is preceded and followed by prayers intended to comfort and strengthen both the sick person and his or her family. If the person is physically capable of receiving the Eucharist, this sacrament is given following the anointing. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The revised forms for celebration of the sacraments also allow for the communal celebration of this sacrament, a communal anointing of the sick and the aged, preferably in the context of the Mass. As in the case of the other sacraments, this practice highlights the communal dimension and expresses the concern of all members of the community for one another. As one member suffers, all suffer, and as one member shares in the joy of the sacrament, all rejoice with him.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">For this reason the communal celebration of Anointing of the Sick should be attended by a substantial representation of the parish community – to show the community’s care, love and support. There are sad cases where the priest is called to the hospital bedside of one who has no family relatives; the nurses are otherwise occupied; no friends or other members of the community can be found. In such cases, the priest represents the community, but where possible ‘the Church’ should be there.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">A sign of God’s love</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The sacraments are great gifts of God. Through them the Lord offers us a share in his own life and power. Certainly the sacraments are not ‘magic’. They have the full effect that God intends only when they are approached with expectant faith. Neither are the sacraments the only way God works. Christians know that the Lord also freely shares his life and gives the Holy Spirit in other ways. Nevertheless, the Bible makes it clear that God chose to assume our human nature, and now chooses to communicate life and love through ordinary, natural signs: water, oil, bread and wine and simple human gestures and interactions. </span><span class="CharOverride-18">These signs, when properly enacted, become channels of God’s abundant love through the merits of Jesus Christ. He is the greatest sacrament of God’s saving love and the founder and life-source of all the sacraments.</span></p>

There is no other relationship which requires so total a commitment of one person to another. In fact, marriage is more than a relationship: it is a union, a communion, between a husband and wife. Without surrendering their individual identities, they form so close a partnership of mind and heart and body, that their life together is different from their lives separately. All their activity should be devoted to strengthening and deepening their union, their communion. There can be no growth unless both grow, no happiness unless both are happy, no real love unless it is mutual.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Christian believes that Marriage is a union between man and woman established by God the Creator as part of the eternal plan for the created world. The vivid description of the creation of the woman in Genesis 2:21-23 reveals God’s intention that man and woman should complement one another, and live together in loving partnership. This story conveys how close was the union of the first human couple, which is presented as a model for marriage: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and they become one flesh</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Genesis 2:24).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading ParaOverride-61"><span class="CharOverride-18">Creative love</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Marriage is God’s way of bringing new human persons into existence. Genesis 1:28 portrays the Creator addressing the first couple: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> Man and woman are thus called to share in the creative love and work of God. But the desire for children is not in itself a sufficient motive for marriage. Mutual love between man and woman is also necessary. But true marital love is not possible, if having children is deliberately excluded.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In both the Old and New Testaments, marriage is held up as wholly desirable for the good of the individual, of the community, and as part of God’s plan for humankind. The Old Testament frequently portrays God’s relationship with Israel, the chosen people, in terms of marital love. Israel is depicted as the bride and God of Israel as the bridegroom. God’s love for this people is pledged in terms of a covenant, and God remains faithful even when the spouse proves unfaithful (Hosea 2:19-20).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In the New Testament, Paul takes up the idea of marriage as a sign of the covenant bond between God and Israel, and applies it to the union between Christ and his Church. After speaking of the love that husband and wife should have for each other, he concludes by saying: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">This is a great mystery, and I am applying it to Christ and the church</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Ephesians 5:32). For Paul, Christian husbands and wives should be a living example of Christ’s loving union with his people.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In telling husbands to love their wives </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Ephesians 5:25), Paul was reminding married couples to strive to reproduce in their life together Christ’s love for his people. When one considers the love of Christ for his own, two qualities of that love stand out in bold relief.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Covenant love</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The first of these is the fidelity of his covenant love. Though we might prove unfaithful, he will never abandon us. His faithfulness is summed up in his final words to his disciples in Matthew’s Gospel: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">I will be with you always</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Matthew 28:20). The second outstanding quality of Christ’s love for his own is its self-sacrificing character.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">We are told in John’s Gospel that </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(John 3:16). Jesus accepted his Father’s will totally. On the eve of his death, he summed up what was to happen to him the following day with the words: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">No one has greater love than this, to lay down one’s life for one’s friends</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (John 15:13).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In fact, self-sacrifice was displayed by Jesus not just in his death, but in his whole life of selfless service of others. So too, his whole life provides a perfect model of fidelity: fidelity to his Father’s will, and fidelity to his disciples. Fidelity and self-sacrifice are those necessary qualities of married love which make Christian Marriage a sign to the world of Christ’s presence.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">A special gift</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">St. Paul also calls Christian Marriage a charism, that is, a special gift from God (1 Corinthians 7:7). Spouses are called to grow in holiness for themselves and for others. By trying to show Christ to each other, by caring for each other in every way, their marriage should help them come to know, love and serve God more faithfully. This is what we mean when we say that their salvation comes through their marriage. To be given care for each other’s spiritual welfare and final salvation is an awesome responsibility, but at the same time Christ provides them with the graces and helps they need to fulfil this responsibility. It is the vocation of the couple, their call from God, the state of life in which they are called to work out their salvation. (There are of course other particular vocations, such as the vocation to the single state. The importance of marriage should not prevent us from seeing the many different ways in which people are called to their Christian vocation.)</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">Marriage: a sacrament</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">All Christians recognise marriage as an important part of Christian life, but Catholics consider it a sacrament. We believe that Jesus raised marriage to a new level. The basis of Christian Marriage is found in the Old Testament, a fact confirmed by Jesus himself. On the basis of the gospel evidence, he did not have a great deal to say on the subject of marriage, but in a discussion which he had with the Pharisees, he did speak very strongly on the subject of divorce and remarriage.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Have you not read that the one who made them at the beginning ‘made them male and female’ ... For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Matthew 19:4-6). He admitted that the Jewish law allowed divorce for a variety of reasons, but argued that this concession was due to the ‘hardness’ of people’s hearts. He insisted that divorce had no part in God’s intention </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">at the beginning</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Matthew 19:8). And so he reinforced his quotation from Genesis 2:24 about the two becoming one, with the words </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">what God has joined together, let no one separate</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Matthew 19:6).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">And in the earliest version of this debate with the Pharisees, in Mark’s Gospel, Jesus condemns divorce and re-marriage in the strongest possible language, which would appear to allow for no exception: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her; and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Mark 10:11-12).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Marriage is a sacrament because it is an action of God. Jesus is adamant about this: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">What God has joined together, let no one separate (Mark 10:9).</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> His words have the effect of re-establishing the indissolubility of marriage that was God’s plan in the beginning, before sin entered the world.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is a sacrament, because Jesus re-invested it with a grace and power that existed in the beginning (Genesis 1), when God gave to the first human beings the grace of fidelity. Through God’s power, conferred in this sacrament, man and woman are enabled to live out faithfully their high calling to become ‘one body’.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Married couples are called to be partners with God in the action of creation itself. This is most obviously achieved through the bearing of children and the raising of family. For parents to gaze into the eyes of their new-born child is to glimpse into the heart of creation itself. At that moment, they sense the wonder and beauty, fear and responsibility of life’s most profound mystery – the constant and miraculous renewal of creation. A parent’s heart is one that is ever-evolving to accommodate the growing and maturing life which they have helped create. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Of course, not all married couples know this experience of being cocreators in this sense. Nevertheless, love has its own powers to give life. Couples who adopt children form a special and unique bond which can be as equally valued as natural birth. As well, other couples who have no children because of infertility or circumstance can still be a profound source of love to those around them. From their married love can flow a generosity and deep affection which gives life to their wider family and community. God is the great creator because God is love. When we love, we are participants in God’s creative power.    </span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">An action of God</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Marriage is a sacrament also because it is an outward, visible sign of Jesus’ presence and love in the world. As Paul points out in the passage from Ephesians mentioned earlier, the love which spouses have for each other is a sign of Christ’s love of his Church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In raising marriage to the level of a sacrament, the Church has identified it as one of those special occasions in the lives of Catholics, when Christ encounters them and communicates to them a special grace which enables them to be faithful for life. Sacramental Marriage, marriage between two Christians, confers on a couple the special gifts and helps they need to make a success of their union, and to fulfil the responsibilities which they undertake towards each other.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Ministers to one another</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">In the sacrament of Marriage, the bride and groom are the ministers of the sacrament. The priest is not the minister of the sacrament, but the Church’s official witness. Christ acts through the couple who, as Christians, are already united to him individually through the sacrament of Baptism. Now in marriage, he gives two people who belong to him as individuals, to belong to each other in a lifelong, grace-giving union.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This, incidentally, is why the Church cannot condone premarital sex. The Church sees a consummated sexual relationship as an expression of that full inter-personal commitment which belongs to the married state. To assume the privileges of full sexual union without the responsibilities of marriage, is to anticipate the action of Christ who gives two people to belong fully to each other.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Under Christ, the bride and groom minister the sacrament of Marriage to each other in what is probably the most important exercise of their lay priesthood. Nor is their mutual ministry of giving and receiving confined to the marriage ceremony alone. This marks only the beginning of a life-long ministry.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Christ’s action continues to strengthen them every day of their married life, as they continue to minister this sacrament to each other.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Each sacrifice of theirs, each act of love, is used by Christ to communicate more of his love. The more they give themselves to each other, the more fully Christ gives himself to them.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Till death us do part</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">It follows from all this that permanence is of the very nature of Christian Marriage. Just as there can be no divorce between Christ and his Church, so there should be none between the Christian husband and wife (see Ephesians 5:25-32).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The fact that marriage is described as a covenant bond shows clearly that God’s intention is that marriage should be a permanent, exclusive union of one man with one woman, until death. Two people pledge themselves to each other for life. In the Catholic Marriage ceremony, when the couple exchange their marriage vows, they promise to love and honour each other all the days of their life. They take each other for better, for worse, in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">until death us do part.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Basing its practice on the words of Jesus quoted earlier, the Church has always taught that there can be no divorce and re-marriage for her members. Other Christian Churches vary in their practice. Those which permit re-marriage for divorced persons claim that Jesus’ teaching should be seen as the presentation of an ideal to be seriously aimed at but not a law binding in all cases. They argue that the compassion which Jesus consistently showed to those who failed justifies their giving another chance to those who fail to attain the ideal proposed by Jesus.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Catholic Church, however, has always seen Jesus’ teaching as being in the realm of law, as the statement of a law permitting no exceptions. Consequently, it has not felt free to modify or adapt this teaching. Not surprisingly, the Church has been accused of taking an excessively hard line on this issue but, on all the biblical evidence, Jesus himself took a ‘hard line’, if you want to call it that.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It might also be noted that, at a time when the institution of marriage is under attack from many quarters, any change in the Church’s practice would constitute a further severe blow against the stability of marriage and the family, something our society can ill afford.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Actually the teaching of Jesus on the permanence and indissolubility of marriage provides the greatest possible protection for human love against human weakness. His words give married people the security of knowing they have all their lives to go on learning to love each other. Nothing less than a life-long commitment is sufficient to exhaust the potential of married love.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">A social problem</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">What Jesus has to say about marriage as a permanent union has special relevance in our day, when a growing number of people seem unwilling or unable to make a permanent commitment to anything or to anyone. We live in a ‘throw-away’ society, in which persons are too often seen as disposable, as well as things.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Since 1990, there has been a decrease in the divorce rate. However, there has also been an overall decrease in the marriage rate over the same period. On the other hand, since dropping to its lowest level in 2001, more recent figures have shown a slight increase in the marriage rate in Australia. Even accounting for the rise from its lowest point, the marriage rate is still not as high as it was in generations past. This demonstrates that the contemporary understanding of marriage and commitment is in a state of flux in our predominately secular society. In this social context, the Church’s teaching on marriage struggles to be heard and understood. Many couples now live together before making any formal commitment to one another. Nevertheless, serious, adequate preparation, as well as mental and emotional maturity, are important and essential ingredients for a lasting marriage. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The appropriate support for married couples, and understanding their concerns, is one of the great pastoral challenges of the Church. Unfortunately many Christian marriages break down and end in the divorce court. The Church allows for separation and, in cases where the spiritual, emotional and physical welfare of people is at risk, accepts divorce without remarriage in order that necessary civil rights can be granted (custody of children, maintenance, and concern for personal safety and well-being). Great pastoral sensitivity is needed to help people in this situation who often feel isolated, unwanted and rejected by the Church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Particular help is needed also for those who remarry in another church or in a civil ceremony. Because their second marriage is not valid ‘in the eyes of the Church,’ they are unable to receive the Eucharist and so find themselves cut off from the centre of their lives as Catholics. People in this situation need great sympathy, friendship and understanding.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Annulment of Marriage</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Catholic tradition firmly believes in the permanency of the marriage bond. The Church also understands that each person’s life story is unique, and that the expectation of making a permanent and loving commitment at the moment of consent (the ‘Exchange of Promises’ during the wedding liturgy) might not have always been possible. Whenever ‘divorce’ has been part of a person’s history, Catholics who wish to re-marry in the Church must enter into a carefully regulated legal system through a regional marriage tribunal. This is also true for those who wish to be fully-initiated into the Catholic tradition and have been divorced and are, or seek to be, remarried. Given that each person’s situation is different and that this is a highly-specialised area, specific questions or concerns are best addressed by trained experts in the area of Church law. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">There are some important distinctions which need to be made. A marriage between a baptised and non-baptised person is considered a true marriage, but not a sacramental marriage. A marriage between two baptised people is considered sacramental because of the Christian witness they give through their married vocation and their ministry to one another. Depending upon the particular and individual circumstances, the Church has a number of distinct processes and procedures. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">A term which is commonly used to describe these processes is ‘annulment’. It should be noted that not every process of dissolving a marriage will involve an annulment. Annulments are distinct from civil divorce and are official Church declarations by the Marriage Tribunal that </span><span class="Strong CharOverride-18">the agreement made by a couple on their wedding day was not the binding agreement it was thought to be</span><span class="CharOverride-18">. An annulment or decree of nullity frees the parties to enter a marriage according to the rites of the Catholic Church once all other requirements of canon law have been fulfilled. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">A decree of nullity does not mean that there was never any love between the parties, that they were lacking sincerity, effort or commitment. Nor does it mean that there was no marriage as generally understood by the community at large. It does mean that the promises made on the wedding day, for a particular reason or reasons, did not have the binding force those present at the wedding thought they had. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Individual circumstances always vary and some situations may be relatively straight-forward and others more complex. In all these circumstances, the Church is attempting to hold in tension its vision for a loving and lasting commitment in marriage, while at the same time acknowledging the realities of human failures and frailties. The prayerful and gracious support of the community of faith is a profound aid to those who find themselves in such circumstances.</span></p>

			<p class="body ParaOverride-13"><span class="text-after-drop-cap CharOverride-18">    rom among his many</span><span class="CharOverride-18"><br /></span><span class="CharOverride-18">followers, </span><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus chose a group of twelve men to whom he devoted special attention and gave special instruction and formation. It was these who after Jesus’ resurrection and </span><span class="CharOverride-18">return to his Father, saw themselves as having the major responsibility for carrying on his mission and ministry. In the early years of Christianity, they came to be known as apostles, although the term apostle was also applied to others who were not members of the original Twelve. Paul, for example, strongly defended his right to be called an apostle (which means literally ‘one who is sent’).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">As we have seen in earlier sessions, the Twelve were given by Jesus the authority to forgive sins. They were also commanded to do in memory of him what he did at the Last Supper, when he pronounced over the bread and wine the words </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">This is my body ... this is my blood</span><span class="CharOverride-18">, and gave it to them to eat and drink (Matthew 26:26,28). </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Gospel of Matthew concludes with these words: Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. ... Jesus came and said to them, ‘All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.’ (Matthew 28:17-20).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">During his time on earth, Jesus demonstrated by both his words and actions that he understood the mission entrusted to him by his Father in terms of service. His life was lived entirely in the service of others, and on several occasions he reminded his disciples that authority and leadership in his community had to be exercised in the same spirit and for the same purpose. At the Last Supper, as a final lesson to them, he performed the humble task of washing their feet and called on them to act in a similar fashion. Finally, Jesus crowned his life of service and self-sacrifice by allowing himself to be led to the cross and to death in obedience to his Father’s will and as a sacrifice for the sins of the world.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Before his return to the Father, Jesus promised his disciples that he would not leave them to act alone. He told them he would not leave them orphans, but he assured them he would send the Holy Spirit to empower them. After his resurrection he concluded his final words of instruction to them with the promise: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">I am with you always, to the end of the age</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Matthew 28:20).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Apostolic ministry</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">After they had received the promised gift of the Spirit at Pentecost, they began their mission in obedience to Christ’s command. The book of the Acts of the Apostles shows them responding to his call to ministry in many different ways – preaching the gospel, curing the sick and caring for the poor. They also began to share their ministry with others – delegating to some the ministry of preaching and to others the ministry of serving the needy. As new needs arose, new members were summoned to meet those needs.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The New Testament does not give us any consistent pattern of the way the original leaders of the Christian community appointed others to succeed them, or how they conferred on others the authority that Jesus had given to them. The ‘laying on of hands’ was evidently an important element in setting people apart for special ministry. Thus in Acts chapter 6, the Twelve ask that seven men should be designated by the Jerusalem community to minister to the poor, so that they might themselves be free to preach the word of God. We are told that the community chose seven and set them </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">before the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Acts 6:5-6). Later in Acts we find that along with the apostles, there was a group of ‘elders’ in the Jerusalem community. These are evidently local church leaders, and presumably they were designated by the apostles in the same way as the seven ministers.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In Acts 13, we are told that </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">while they</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (the community at Antioch) </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, ‘Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them’. Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Acts 13:2-3). There follows an account of an extensive missionary tour by Saul (Paul) and Barnabas, as they took the gospel of Christ to Cyprus and Asia Minor. Towards the end of this campaign, Luke, the author of Acts, tells us Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for them in each church (Acts 14:23).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The second letter to Timothy, written towards the end of the first century, informs us that Paul laid hands on Timothy to set him apart for the ministry, and reminded him </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(2 Timothy 1:6). By the end of the century, it seems clear that in all the local churches there were </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">presbyteroi </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(elders or presbyters) or </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">episkopoi</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (overseers or bishops) who had pastoral and administrative care of their communities. The laying on of hands accompanied by prayer by which these local leaders were designated is seen as the beginning of the sacrament of Holy Orders or ordination, and also the beginning of what is known as ‘apostolic succession’.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">A developing idea</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Significantly there is no mention of Christian priests in the New Testament. The only priests mentioned are Jewish priests and the word is never applied to the apostles, or to the elders – overseers. Jesus alone is designated as priest, our great high priest, and then only in one New Testament writing, the letter to the Hebrews. This suggests that the notion of priesthood was an idea which needed time to develop as Christians grew in self-understanding. This development no doubt paralleled their growing understanding of the Eucharist from messianic banquet, to memorial, to sacrificial meal. The disappearance of the Jewish priesthood after the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in 70 AD would have accelerated the understanding that Christians had their own sacrifice (the Eucharist) and needed a priesthood to offer it.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Catholics have traditionally seen the Last Supper as the occasion when Jesus instituted both the Eucharist and the priesthood, and the Council of Trent has defined that Christ indeed instituted the sacrament of Orders on that occasion. One need not however understand this definition to mean that the Twelve considered themselves to have been ordained priests by Jesus on the eve of his death. What Trent intended to affirm was that the Eucharist and the priesthood are so essentially related to what Jesus did at the Last Supper, that in the theological sense they can be said to have been instituted there. The elements of the later Christian priesthood are to be found in Christ’s words and actions at the Last Supper, but it required time for this to be fully appreciated and understood.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">By the late first century AD, we have evidence for the existence in the Church of presbyters and bishops (or overseers) – the terms seem to be interchangeable in the New Testament – and deacons. By the middle of the second century, as a result of further development, a much clearer structure had emerged with a ‘three-tiered’ leadership: a single bishop in each local church, assisted by a group of presbyters and deacons. This soon became the norm for the entire Catholic world. The Catholic Church has preserved this basic pattern of official leadership and succession from the second century down to the present day.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Priesthood in history</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">In the history of religions, the office of priesthood has always occupied a prominent place. The history of priesthood is almost as old as the history of humanity. Every civilisation has recognised the need to worship and has set aside people whose principal task it has been to represent the whole people before God. Among the Israelites, the people of the Old Testament, there was no ordained priesthood, strictly speaking. One family, the family of Levi, was designated as the priestly family, and all male members born unto this family served the people of Israel as its priests.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The priest was regarded as someone set apart, chosen, called by God. His task was to consult God, to teach the law and to offer sacrifices on behalf of the people. They thus functioned as mediators between God and the people. At first, the sacrifices were the first fruits of the crops, or animals, but eventually it came to be realised that what God wanted above all was the sacrifice of a ‘humble and contrite heart’, of which the other offerings were merely symbols. With the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD, and the end of sacrifice as an element of Jewish Liturgy, the priesthood of Israel disappeared from history.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Priesthood of all believers</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">It was also part of Jewish teaching that the whole nation constituted a priesthood, that is, the whole people was set apart, chosen and called by God to service (Exodus 19:6). This idea is taken up in 1 Peter and applied to all Christians: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (1 Peter 2:9). This means that Jesus’ priesthood is shared in a sense by all believers. All members of the Church have been called and chosen, and have the responsibility to carry on Christ’s mission. This responsibility comes in the first place through Baptism and is sealed by Confirmation. Through the Spirit, Christ shares his gifts with us, enabling us to carry out our mission. Paul elaborates on how the various gifts of the Spirit help us to live out our call to service (1 Corinthians 12:4-11). While there is a common mission which belongs to all members of the priestly people there is at the same time a variety of ministries, and among them are the ordained ministries of the deacon, the priest and the bishop.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">The ordained ministry</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is Catholic teaching that the bishops are successors of the apostles, and as such have a universal mission to teach. It is their particular duty to see that the gospel is proclaimed everywhere. The bishops of the Catholic world constitute a ‘college’, which enables them to work together, and in union with the Pope. As such, they are a sign of the universality and diversity of the Church, and by their ministry they strive to promote unity among the people of God. They possess a three-fold ministry which may be summarised by the words prophet, priest and shepherd, words which apply directly to Christ but can by extension be applied to the bishop and indeed to every priest.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The term ‘prophet’ expresses the fact that when proclaiming the gospel the bishop speaks for God or on God’s behalf. When he is on his own, he speaks with an authority that demands respect. When, however the whole college of bishops speaks, in communion with the Pope, bishops teach with the full authority of the Church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In his priestly role, the bishop has responsibility for the proper celebration of the liturgy and administration of the sacraments in his diocese. There are different orders or degrees of ordained ministry and the bishop, who is highest in rank, is said to have the fullness of priesthood. Priests, although they act with a certain amount of independence, are in fact coworkers of the bishop, and share in his ministry. Sacramentally, the main difference between bishops and priests is that the former can ordain other bishops and priests, and are by office the official proclaimers of the word and celebrants of the liturgy in their dioceses. The bishop also ordinarily confers the sacrament of Confirmation, although this is a function which he may delegate to his priests.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">As shepherd, the bishop is the chief pastor and the spiritual father of the Church in the diocese where he has been appointed to serve. One of the symbols of his office is the shepherd’s staff. His concern must be for justice and integrity and his care for all, especially the poor and the suffering. To his brother priests his duty is to be a friend and support, advisor and counsellor.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Among the roles of the priest, in the words of the former ordination rite, are </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">to preach, to offer sacrifice and to baptise</span><span class="CharOverride-18">. The priest has the same three-fold ministry as the bishop, and this can best be appreciated and understood under the headings: ministry of the word, ministry of the sacrament and ministry of service.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Minister of the word <br />and sacrament</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">As minister of the word, the priest’s privilege and responsibility is to break open the word of God, to make it his own and share it with others. His life should give concrete expression to the gospel; he is to repeat Christ’s call to conversion and holiness; he is to reflect on the word, to help people to discover its relevance for them in today’s world, and to teach in unity with the whole Church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">If the primary task of the priest is to proclaim the gospel, the source of his proclamation and its summit is the Eucharist. The priest is called to be a sacrament of Christ, and all he does should be done in memory of Christ. His task is to make Christ really present to others in the sacraments of healing and forgiving, loving and serving, sharing and sacrificing. He should as far as possible identify the liturgical actions he performs with his own life, so that, for example, his celebration of the sacrament of Reconciliation becomes an extension of the forgiveness which should be his normal way of life. As minister of the sacraments of the church, the priest must make himself really present to others, and be always aware of Christ working through him.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Ministry of service</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">As we have seen the keynote of all ministry in the teaching of Jesus is that of service. The leadership which a priest exercises must be in terms of service of others. His service is to make growth possible. It is God who provides the growth through the Spirit imparted in different ways to different people. The priest’s task is to help people discover their gifts, and to encourage them to use these gifts in a way which contributes to the common good. His call is to serve his people in word and in sacrament, in kindness and generosity, in giving encouragement and comfort.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Bond of unity</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Just as the bishop is the centre of the unity for the diocese so should the priest be a bond of unity for the people of the parish. Another ordained ministry is the order of deacon, for which there is evidence in the New Testament itself. A deacon may baptise, preach, celebrate marriages, officiate at funerals, and preside over certain forms of worship and prayer services. Some of the functions of the deacon are now shared among members of the ‘lay priesthood’, such as the ministry of the Eucharist both in the liturgy and to the sick and dying.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Deacons may not preside at the celebration of the Eucharist, nor act as Christ’s ministers in the sacrament of Reconciliation. In the current practice of the Church, before a person is ordained to the order of priesthood, he must first be ordained to the order of deacon. Besides this state of ‘temporary’ deaconate, the Church in more recent years has revived the ‘permanent’ deaconate, a ministry which was common in the early Church. In many countries, including Australia, there are men, married as well as single, who are serving the Church as ordained deacons.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Celebrating the sacrament</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The sacrament of Holy Orders is celebrated within the Mass, and most often in the Cathedral church of the local diocese. The climax of the ordination ceremony occurs when the ordaining bishop and other priests who are present impose their hands on the head of the one being ordained. There follows a series of symbolic actions: the newly ordained priest puts on the vestments which are used in the celebration of Mass. His hands are anointed with chrism, the blessed oil which is used also in Baptism and Confirmation, and he is presented with a cup of wine and the bread to be consecrated. He then joins the bishop and other priests to celebrate with them the Eucharist for the first time.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Priests of the Roman or Latin rite (as distinct from the Eastern Catholic rite) are obliged to celibacy, that is to remain unmarried. This practice began in the fourth century, and was gradually extended until it became the law for the whole western Church by the tenth century. </span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Priestly celibacy</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Celibacy has no essential or intrinsic connection with the priesthood. It is a law of the Church which could be changed if it were thought to be necessary or desirable, because celibacy is not an absolute requirement for priesthood. The Eastern rites of the Catholic Church allow married men to be ordained to the priesthood, a practice which reflects their culture and Christian tradition. There are particular circumstances where married men are ordained to priesthood. In such cases, these men had previously been ordained and served as ministers in other Christian traditions and have since been received into the Catholic Church. In recent times, special structures have been established within the Catholic Church to receive former Anglican clergy and lay people into full communion, while retaining dimensions of their Anglican disciplines and rituals. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">At the most practical level, celibacy is advantageous from the point of view of time and economics. While there are good arguments in favour of a married priesthood, there is also no doubt that a celibate priest has the time and freedom to be available, mobile and committed to a degree that would be difficult for a responsible married man with a family (see 1 Corinthians 7:32-34). At the same time, we must acknowledge the commitment and dedication of married clergy throughout the Christian world. Certainly the requirement of celibacy should not be seen as a negative evaluation of the married state, and there seems little to be gained by discussing the relative merits of the two states, or the superiority of one over the other.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">On a higher level, the level of witness, celibacy as a state freely chosen for religious motives has an important value as a sign. Jesus himself was celibate, and both he and Paul taught that celibacy undertaken for the sake of the kingdom is an important gospel value. Both also make it clear that celibacy is not a call given to the majority, but that it is a gift that enables some followers of Christ to devote their individual attention to the affairs of the Lord and his kingdom. Since the early Church, men and women have committed themselves to God in this way. Celibacy is a sign or witness in that it involves renouncing some undeniably good things – sexual pleasure within marriage and the good of married life – for another good: greater freedom to devote time and attention to the Lord and to the building up of his body, the Church for the sake of the kingdom.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Celibacy is not a sign that may impress many people in today’s world, and it may often be obscured by human weakness and failure, as has been the case with many public scandals over recent decades. But in itself, voluntary celibacy for the sake of Christ and the kingdom points to the need for every Christian to have one fundamental relationship before all others – namely, with Jesus Christ.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This claim for celibacy does not imply that the married state does not also have a sign value. Both marriage and celibacy are called ‘charisms’ (gifts of God) by Paul in 1 Corinthians 7:7, and both states of life should bear witness to Christ.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Catholic understanding of priesthood causes difficulties for many Christians. Besides the requirement of celibacy, some Christians object to the title ‘Father’ which they believe violates Jesus’ command in Matthew 23:9: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">call no one your father on earth, for you have one Father – the one in heaven.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> However, the intention behind Jesus’ words is that no human being may be given the honour and respect due only to God the Father. One should also take note of the words of Paul in 1 Corinthians 4:15: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">For though you might have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers. Indeed, in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is in this sense that Catholics apply the title ‘father’ to priests.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Ordination of women</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Another Catholic practice that is commonly questioned is the requirement that only men be ordained to the priesthood. A number of other Christian traditions ordain women, and many theologians have argued that there are no obvious theological reasons standing in the way of the ordination of women. They point to the significant role women played in the ministry of Jesus and claim that the exclusion of women is not a matter of doctrine, but of cultural inheritance. However, the Roman Catholic Church has strongly rejected these arguments.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Because there is no precedent for the ordination of women to priesthood during the early centuries of the Church, the Catholic Church has continued its practice of ordaining only men to this office. In 1994, St John Paul II issued an apostolic letter </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Ordinatio Sacerdotalis (On Reserving Priestly Ordination to Men Alone) </span><span class="CharOverride-18">in which he declared that the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women, and that this judgement is to be definitively held by all the faithful. Subsequently the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith affirmed that this teaching was part of ‘the deposit of faith’. It described the Pope’s decision as a teaching that has been set forth infallibly by the ordinary and universal magisterium or teaching authority of the Church. Therefore, the Roman Catholic Church considers the discussion of ordaining women to the priesthood closed. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Other Christians are also confused by the various titles given to ordained ministers in the Catholic Church: deacons, priests, monsignor, bishops, archbishops, abbots, cardinals, monks, nuns, religious sisters and brothers. These titles distinguish the different roles, orders or functions of these ministers. The important thing is that they all share in the one priesthood of Christ as ministers set apart for leadership and service in the Body of Christ. As we have said earlier, the Catholic understanding is that the bishops (a category which includes the Pope, archbishops and most cardinals) possess ‘the fullness of the sacrament of Orders’, while priests and deacons share in and extend the priestly ministry of their bishop. This understanding is based on the way ordained leadership actually evolved and functioned in the history of the Church, which Catholics believe was directed by the Holy Spirit.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Religious life</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The majority of priests are ordained for service in a diocese, and are called diocesan or secular priests. Others belong to religious communities whose members take vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. These include Franciscans, Jesuits, Dominicans, Redemptorists, and so on.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">‘Religious’ men and women consecrate themselves in a special way to God’s service by their vows. Their way of life is intended to be a sign to others of the presence of Christ’s kingdom here on earth, and a reminder that the full experience of the kingdom is yet to come.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The vow of poverty is designed to free the religious of all attachment to the riches of this world, and to remind them of the one great possession, Jesus Christ. By the vow of chastity, they promise fidelity to the obligations attached to purity, and are a sign to the world of their willingness to be at the service of all who call upon them, for the sake of the gospel. Their vow of obedience implies an offering of themselves to serve Christ by serving the Christian community.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Ordinarily, a religious lives a common life in a religious community with others who have taken similar vows. Religious communities were founded to meet specific needs in the Church, which may change as times and needs change. Today there are numerous religious communities of sisters and brothers serving in a variety of ministries. Their ministries include teaching, hospital work, social work, missionary work, and pastoral work in parishes. Brothers and nuns have made an enormous contribution to the life of the Church in this country and all over the world.</span></p>

All in the Church have been chosen, set apart and commissioned. Everyone who belongs to the Church has the responsibility to continue Christ’s work and to share in the mission of the Church. While there is a common mission which belongs to all members of this priestly people there is at the same time a variety of ministries. The ordained ministry is one of these ministries and needs to be seen in the context of the ministry to which the Church as a whole is called. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Many of the words which Jesus addressed to his original disciples on the need for them to see themselves as servants of others, were addressed to them not only as future leaders of his community, but precisely as disciples. They are words addressed to all followers of Christ, whatever their rank or status in the Church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Church, although of divine origin and guided by the Holy Spirit, is also a human organisation, and has always been very much shaped by her historical environment, just as she is being shaped by the environment of today.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Changing structures</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Her structures have often, if not always, been influenced by the structures prevailing in society at large; and one or other element of the structure has sometimes found itself emphasised in reaction to attacks made against it. If the Protestant reformers had not singled out the papacy, the institution of bishops, and the ordained priesthood as special targets of attack, the respective roles of clergy and laity would probably not be exactly as they are in the present day Church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It was partly as the result of these assaults at the time of the reformation, that later theology came to emphasise so strongly a centralised authority and the ordained ministry in the Church, at the expense of shared authority and other forms of ministry. Inevitably, papal power grew at the expense of the college of bishops; in the diocese, the bishop’s power grew at the expense of the clergy; and the priests’ power grew at the expense of the laity.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The centralisation had its advantages in terms of solidity and uniformity, but there were negative side effects: the bishops grew more passive in relation to the Pope, as did the clergy with regard to the bishop, and the laity vis-a-vis the priest. A situation arose where lay involvement in the Church’s affairs came to be seen almost as superfluous. The Church’s work was understood to be the business of the professionals – Pope, bishops, priests and religious.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">But it was not always so. In the early Church there are examples of lay people baptising, electing clergy and even bishops. They attended Church councils and spoke up in matters of doctrine. In the New Testament, as we have seen, the whole Christian people is addressed as a priesthood – which has given rise to the expression, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">priesthood of the laity.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">A different focus</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Prior to the second Vatican Council the level of lay participation in decision-making at all levels was very low. As a result of the Council, a different picture of the Church began to emerge. Just as Pope John XXIII was surrounded by his Bishops in Council in 1962, so today the Pope is with his Synod of Bishops; the diocesan bishop with his presbyterate (body of priests); the parish priest with his council of laity – these are meant to be expressions of the Church which the Council wanted to promote. The creation or re-creation of these structures is part of the renewed emphasis on the common mission of the whole people of God.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">These new structures in no way supplant or undermine the offices of Pope, bishop or priest. They rather complement them and provide them with a context in which they can better realise their full meaning. From what we have said, it should be clear that the lay person’s call to ministry does not derive from any state of emergency in the Church – such as a shortage of priests (as Pope Pius XI suggested was the case). There is no denying that there is a scarcity of vocations to the ordained ministry: the Church does need more priests.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">Signs of the times</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">However the Holy Spirit is also sending the Church a message at this time. Lay involvement in the life of the Church is not dependent upon a limited number of clergy. Lay involvement is not a substitute for fewer clergy, but a proper and important expression of the Church’s very life. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Vocations are present in big numbers throughout the Church in lay people who are willing to take up their share of ministry in partnership with priests and religious. And priests will have a clearer sense of their own identity, when they serve as pivotal or organisational leaders, around whom other ministers or servants can gather, and from whom they can draw encouragement, motivation and inspiration.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">One of the more encouraging signs of life in the Church today is the ever-increasing acknowledgement among the laity that ministry is the responsibility of all, coming directly from Christ himself, especially through the sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">A real community or family exists only when people are prepared to open their minds and hearts to the needs of others, when they feel that they are accepted by others and that they really belong. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Different parish communities have different needs, but in every parish there is the common need to draw people into the active life of the Church, so that they can use their talents in a way that makes them feel they really have a role in the Church – that they truly are the Church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">There are so many needs and so many human resources that no member of the Church should remain unwanted or unfulfilled.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The chapter on priesthood, referred to a passage from Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 12). Paul’s imagery of the Church as a body comprising many different members, encompasses the possibility that there will be non-functioning or mal-functioning parts. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The whole body inevitably suffers, with some parts becoming over-exerted and others tending to wither up for want of use. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">There is also the danger of members of the body being misused, with the result that the body as a whole does not function harmoniously (see 1 Corinthians 12:14-26).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">A variety of gifts</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">In the same chapter Paul has a passage in which he says: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are varieties of services, but the same Lord; and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who activates all of them in everyone. To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (12:4-7). A little later on, he writes: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then deeds of power, then gifts of healing, forms of assistance, forms of leadership, various kinds of tongues</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (12:27-28).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Every person has been given gifts by God. In the Divine plan these gifts can be used for the benefit of the whole Christian community. There is a parable in the Gospels, in which Jesus praises the servants who are prepared to make use of their gifts and risk them, but condemns the one who buries his gift fearfully in the sand (Matthew 25:14-30). Not to recognise one’s gift for ministry, or to deny that one has such a gift, is really a denial of the glory of God. It is a failure to recognise what Paul recognised in his own case: that the power of God is often most effective when it operates through human weakness.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Members of the Church should be aware of their gifts, their rights, their responsibilities, and the needs of the community and of individuals in the community. The Church relies on all its members, according to their respective gifts and their particular vocation to ministry.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Spirit is given to each person as an individual, but for the benefit of all. The Spirit was given to the first disciples of Jesus, precisely when they were all together and of one mind in prayer and love (Acts 1:14; 2:1). The Spirit is the principle of unity in the Church. The Spirit dwells within each of us as a kind of inner law of unity and community. If a person’s bodily members are separated from one another, they cease to live. So too, the Holy Spirit who is the principle of personal faith and of the individual Christian life, binds the members of the Church together. The Spirit brings together in unity the gifts which are implanted in individual persons.</span></p>

			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The main need of every Christian community (normally a parish) is to make Christ realistically accessible to people in the locality. We have the perfect model in Jesus. He gave witness by his life and by his compassion and concern for all classes of people. Jesus showed that loving each person as they are is the most important service that we can perform for them. It is this which brings happiness and hope. The local community which achieves this can say it is indeed living the gospel.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">One way to achieve this goal is to divide a parish into smaller areas, so that the parish is seen as a ‘communion of communities’. This enables responsibility to be delegated to people with a more realistic and manageable scope for the exercise of their ministry. It also helps to break down the impression of the parish as a large, impersonal, institutional structure.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It means opening our eyes to the needs of the people in our families, the people in our block of units or street, and the people in our work place or where we take our recreation. It means also asking ourselves what we can do in our circumstances to respond to those needs. It may mean just a cheerful word or word of encouragement, or some small service. It may however demand some action that costs us more, like standing up for the rights of people who are powerless, or working for justice for those who are victims of oppression, legalised or otherwise. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">If some action along these lines is not taken, the people whom Christ loves in our area will see the parish church as little more than a building where some people meet for worship. It is our hope that our Christian witness and mission to the world will be a visible and tangible sign of God’s reign of mercy, justice and love. Through our worhsip we nourish and sustain our share in God’s mission.  </span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Building up the <br />Body of Christ</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The other field in which we are called to use our gifts is for our own Catholic community. It may be by taking some special role in worship, such as minister of communion, reader, server, musician or singer. It may be as a catechist, sponsor or in some other capacity in the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults (RCIA). There are a whole range of possible activities that are of real service to our fellow church members. Sometimes the roles may not be prominent or glamorous – keeping the church and sacristy clean, providing tea or coffee after Mass, offering a lift to elderly people to enable them to attend Mass. But all of these make a necessary contribution to the well-being of the community. These are all contributions to the effort of a team. Paul warns us not to neglect or ignore the members of the body or their gifts which might be judged to be of lesser importance. Often they are worthy of the greatest honour.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">What is important is that individuals or groups do not just ‘do their own thing’ without reference to the ministry of others. There is need of someone who will act as coordinator as well as guide and motivator. It is the parish priest who is expected to fill this role.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Church to which we belong, the Church which we are, is therefore a community of brothers and sisters created by God to serve one another and to serve God’s world. The Church’s ministry is a continuation of the ministry of Christ, and this ministry has always been exercised through various individuals, and in specific ways – depending on the needs, the conditions and the circumstances of particular times in history.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Kinds of ministry</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Ministry is a word that is frequently used in many different ways. The word ‘ministry’ is a translation of the Greek word diakonia. Over the last couple of decades, the precise theological meaning of this term has been debated both through scholarly research and ecumenical dialogue. Historical research has shown that the ancient Greek word was used in very specific circumstances and in relation to particular tasks. It was not a word that was applied generally to all acts of loving service. In other words, not everything was seen as ‘ministry’. However, ecumenical dialogues tend to highlight baptism as the basis for Christian ministry. In this context, every baptised person is understood to be, in some form, a ‘minister’.  </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">What can be said about ministry is this: firstly, it is about the person of Jesus Christ and is related to his service to the world. In this sense, ministry is ‘symbolic’ because it shows forth Jesus and not the minister. Secondly, ministry emerges from ‘charismatic’ gifts, that is ‘God-given gifts’, which are called forward by the Church into ministry. And lastly, the purpose of ministry is to build up the Body of Christ to enable all to share in a deeper unity and come to a deeper faith. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Ministry finds its clearest expression in the three-fold ministry of Christ: priest, prophet and king. All the baptised share in these dimensions of Christ’s service. Ministry, therefore, is clearly broader than simply ordained ministry. Nevertheless, ministry is a specific term that relates to particular roles within the Church which are clearly based in the person and ministry of Jesus Christ, is nourished and supported by necessary gifts and gives life to the Body of Christ. </span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading ParaOverride-47">Mission and ministry</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">To help us establish our true identity and our call to service within the Church, it might help if we recognise the distinction between two terms which are often used interchangeably: ministry and mission. Certainly the two do often overlap but in reality they are complementary.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">We usually speak of the mission of the Church but it is more correct to say that the Church is a sign of God’s mission. It is God’s mission to renew creation and the Church shares in that mission. The mission of the Church is to cooperate with the Spirit of God which already is alive and active in the world. The Church is a sign of unity and an instrument of God’s peace. It is God’s partner in the proclamation of the gospel to the ends of the earth. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Ministry, on the other hand, is primarily an activity that takes place within the Church. Ministry are those activities which build up the Body of Christ and nourish and sustain its missionary work. Ministry is not to be seen as a turning-in on ourselves nor as an abdication of our responsibility to go out to others.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Church is by its very nature a missionary community, but if the Church is to be equipped in the best way possible to carry out effectively its missionary mandate, it needs that strength and vitality which can come only from our mutual ministry to one another. So ministry and mission really go together: one demands the other. </span></p>

What do I consider good in life?’ As small children, almost all the practical decisions were made for us by other people, and we had little opportunity to choose. We were told by others what was good. Only gradually did we begin to make real choices for ourselves, and even then we continued for many years to rely a great deal on our parents, teachers and other significant people in our lives.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The moral life is about our choices, it is the life we create by our free choices. Whenever we freely choose to do something we create something which otherwise would not have existed. But we do not just create situations, or things outside of ourselves. By our choices we reveal who we are and we create ourselves to be the persons we are becoming. So the moral life is about who we are and who we are going to be.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">As children we generally did not have many choices. We did things because we were told to do them. Sometimes we might not have understood why we should do these things. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">As we matured we grew to understand there were things which we recognised as being good and as needing to be respected. It was no longer a question of what someone else said, or of avoiding trouble, or of looking for a reward, or even of not wanting to hurt another person. Instead it became part of our being that to do this was right, and to do that was wrong, because it was good or bad. We understood that standing behind what was ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ was what was good or bad. In other words, our conscience had begun to grow and guide our actions from within us and we assumed more responsibility for our own choices.</span></p>

			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (1 John 4:16). These words from the First Letter of John express with remarkable clarity the heart of the Christian faith and life. We are called to ‘Live in God.’ Our moral life is a response to God’s love for us. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">St John Paul II in his encyclical, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">The Splendour of Truth (Veritatis Splendor), </span><span class="CharOverride-18">describes it as living in a way that all our choices are ordered towards communion with God.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">How do we know our choices are ordered towards God? St John Paul II also reminds us that the great commandment of Jesus is a twofold commandment: Love God and love your neighbour as yourself.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">To love someone means to desire that person’s true good, his or her flourishing as a human being, and to be willing to do what we can to help that flourishing. So the moral life is about a life directed towards the good of human persons, including our own good. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">So the moral life is not something which represses our humanity. On the contrary, the good moral life is that which is most fully truly human.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">How can we know what leads to truly flourishing and living in communion with God? Remember when the rich young man asked Jesus: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">What must I do to inherit eternal life?, </span><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus responded: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">… keep the commandments</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Matthew 19:16-17). Jesus was pointing the young man to what God had already revealed about the good.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Biblical morality</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Christian moral life is based on God’s revelation, the word of God. Belief in God has implications for how we live our life. The record of this divine revelation is found in the Bible. The Old Testament is the record of God’s self-revelation to the people of Israel, and through them, to the world. The key point of Old Testament revelation and of Israel’s religion was the Exodus – an event which revealed that God freely chose them to be God’s special people, delivered them from their condition of slavery, and initiated a covenant with them.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Covenant which God made with Israel is described in Exodus chapter 20. It is based on the pattern of call and response. The God of the Covenant took the initiative of establishing a loving relationship with them, and invited them to respond to this offer of love and protection. Their response to this call was seen to imply or demand certain attitudes and conduct, not only towards God but also towards their fellow members of the covenant community. Moreover, this covenant was itself a revelation of what was the good way of life.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Jewish people were convinced that God had made a covenant with them, promises to them, that would never be broken. God would be their God and they would be God’s people; whatever happened, God would never forget them or abandon them. For their part, the Jews knew they had to live according to the Law which had been given to them through Moses at Mt Sinai, soon after their deliverance from Egypt. This Law was an integral part of the covenant, and its essential part is what we know as the Ten Commandments.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Understanding <br />the commandments</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The commandments are a summary of how we should relate to God (by worship) and to one another (by mutual respect and reverence). They are in reality particular expressions of the twin laws of love: love of God and love of neighbour.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In one sense Israel’s Law was new, because unlike other earlier and contemporary codes of law, it was based on belief in one God and the need to worship this God alone. However, its content was wholly familiar to the Jews, because it expressed what they had come to know and understand over the years about how they should live. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">While the purpose of law is to give guidance for future activity, it also (to some extent) inevitably follows from, and reflects, the experience of past history. Those commandments which enjoin such values as respect for life, respect for truth, respect for parents, respect for marriage and family, and respect for another’s property are really statements of the ‘natural’ law. The attitudes and values which they enshrine were the fruit of human experience and reflection, people grasping what was good. They might even be said to be attitudes and values which a right conscience should acknowledge instinctively. It is not surprising therefore that similar ways of living were found also in other ancient codes of law.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The promulgation of the Law (described from Exodus 19 onwards) was seen as a deeply significant moment in Jewish history. Exodus 19:4-8 is one of the classical passages of the Old Testament. To Moses, the chosen mediator, God makes an astonishing offer: having already delivered them from the hands of the Egyptians, if the Israelites will choose to abide by the covenant, they will in turn receive a privileged status as God’s own people, God’s treasured possession, a kingdom of priests, a holy nation (vv. 5-6). In this plan to save the world, they are given a special place and a unique intimacy with God. In turn, much will be demanded of them – they must be holy as God is holy. However, this special vocation was not forced on the people but left to their free choice. In verse eight, they readily accept the terms of the covenant.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Henceforth, the Jews would always regard the Law as the main pillar of their faith and practice. It indicated how they should respond to God’s covenant invitation, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">you shall be my people, and I will be your God</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Ezekiel 36:28). They also believed that the Law revealed the wisdom of their God and living by God’s Law demonstrated the wisdom of Israel (Deuteronomy 4:6-8). Because Christians see themselves as the new people of God, the spiritual descendants of Israel, the Law will always stand. The Ten Commandments are not a list of arbitrary laws imposed at the whim of a capricious dictator, but an expression of what conforms to the very best in human nature.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus himself said that he did not come to abolish the Law but to complete it, fulfil it and perfect it. He even said that not even the tiniest part of this Law of God was to be done away with (Matthew 5:17-20). Many Old Testament rules and regulations dealing with temple sacrifice and ritual, legal purity and so on, became obsolete with the coming of Christ, but the Ten Commandments have a universal force and retain their permanent, binding character even in the Christian era.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Exploring the commandments </span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">At this point, we might just recall the Ten Commandments, and look briefly at their contents and what they require of us by way of response to God’s love.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The first three commandments provide specific regulations to govern our relationship with God. The first commandment (Exodus 20:3-6) is a demand for belief in one God only. This commandment embodies the truth of who God is, and the appropriate response to this truth. Recognition of this truth distinguished Israel from the neighbouring pagan countries, which all worshipped a whole host of gods and goddesses. Along with this went the prohibition against attempting to make images of the Divine. Again the purpose was to acknowledge the truth of their God, and once again it distinguished them from their neighbours, all of whom fashioned and worshipped images of their national gods. So the commandment was primarily a condemnation of idolatry. The original form of the commandment was probably something like this: ‘I, the Lord, am your God. You shall have no other gods besides me’.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The second commandment (Exodus 20:7) is concerned with the use of the divine name. The law against ‘taking God’s name in vain’, seems to mean: ‘You shall not make evil use of the name of the Lord, your God’. This would be done by using the divine name in cases of perjury (calling on God to witness to a lie), or by appealing to the divine name in support of curses or other evil activities.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The third commandment (Exodus 20:8-11) deals with observance of the Sabbath, an ancient practice in Israel. Later on, more and more precise requirements were drawn up about observance of the Lord’s day, but the commandment itself simply consecrates a period of time to God. Christians changed the special day for worship to the first day of the week, in honour of Christ’s resurrection on that day. The motivation given to observe this law is our need to imitate God, who ceased creative activity on the seventh day.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The first three commandments deal with our relations with God. The fourth through to the tenth  commandment outline laws governing relations with our fellow men and women. The first to be stressed is one’s obligation to one’s parents. And it should be noted that this precept is in no way restricted to children.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The fifth commandment seeks to protect the sacredness of human life by forbidding murder. It teaches that human life is to be protected and nourished.  </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The sixth commandment sets out to safeguard the sanctity of marriage; and the seventh, the sanctity of private property. Originally the seventh commandment, ‘Thou shalt not steal’, may also have envisaged abduction or kidnapping, the taking of a person’s freedom.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The eighth commandment forbids false witness and may originally have looked directly at perjury in legal proceedings, but it was probably not restricted to this. It excluded also any false statement that was damaging to one’s neighbour.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The ninth and tenth commandments both condemn illicit desires, which may lead to the actions, adultery and theft, already prohibited in the sixth and seventh commandments. The term ‘house’ (coveting a neighbour’s house) was intended to cover all material possessions – the dwelling and everything in it.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This then is a brief summary of the Ten Commandments, which the Bible tells us were given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai, as part of the covenant made with God’s people. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">We do a grave injustice to the people of Israel if we imagine that their relationship with God was founded on fear. The fact is that the devout Israelites of earlier days, before the Exile, had a very healthy attitude to God’s law. They saw the commandments as the way of life, a life of wisdom and love. They certainly did not consider them an oppressive burden, or the law of a God of wrath, but as an expression of the will of a God of love. Their observance of the Law was based not on fear, but on love and gratitude for the blessings they had received, and recognition of the wisdom of their God.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Law and legalism</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">It was only much later, with the growth of Judaism after the Exile, and the rise to prominence of the scribes and Pharisees, that the Jewish attitude to the Law changed, which Jesus was to castigate so severely. The religious leaders of Judaism came to see the commandments as primarily a code of law rather than as a divine gift. It ceased to be a charter of liberty. As a result, the people fell into slavery once more: slavery to the law. Legalism emerges when one loses sight of the good behind the law.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Old Testament prophets, on the other hand, constantly described the covenant relationship between God and God’s people as a most intimate one. They expressed it in terms of a father-son relationship, and as a loving union between husband and wife. Love and mercy were the features of this relationship, a love that was gratuitous and unconditional, and a forgiveness that knew no limits.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In the Old Testament the prophet Hosea writes beautifully about the covenant relationship between God and the Israelites through the metaphor of marriage (2:19,20): </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">I will take you for my wife for ever; I will take you for my wife in righteousness and in justice, in steadfast love, and in mercy. I will take you for my wife in faithfulness; and you shall know the Lord.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">God’s many loving and saving interventions on Israel’s behalf were intended to elicit a total response of love and obedience to God’s will. It was God’s plan that Israel’s whole pattern of life would be such a response to this call. But Israel was guilty of chronic infidelity. The biblical writers underline this pattern – God’s fidelity to promises meeting continually with human infidelity and disobedience.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Images of God</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">There are still today those who think of God first and foremost as a law-giver, and a hard task-master who in the end will demand his pound of flesh. This unhappy picture does not do justice to the reality and can lead to a serious lack of balance. A truer picture found in the Old Testament is that of God as Father of his people, a God of infinite mercy and compassion, one who perfectly understands the human condition, and while never condoning sin is always ready to forgive. The prayers of the Jewish people (especially the Psalms) clearly reflect this image of God. They display complete confidence in God as the one who saves. Emphasis on God’s readiness to forgive should not of course encourage the conclusion that God’s law is unimportant – far from it. God expects us to live under the guidance of this law and in this way to grow.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This revelation of God to Israel formed the basis of Israel’s moral law, summarised in the Ten Commandments. Christians believe that God’s self-revelation reached its climax in the person of the Son, Jesus, the Word made flesh. The Exodus revealed to the Israelites a great deal about the love of God. But that love can be fully appreciated, only when it is seen revealed in the life and death of Jesus, God-made-man. In him we have the fullest possible insight into God’s character, especially God’s love and mercy; in him we also have the perfection of the pattern of call and response that runs throughout the story of revelation.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus – the </span><span class="CharOverride-18">p</span><span class="CharOverride-18">erfect model</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus is the perfect model of how to live according to the fullness of God’s revelation, and he invites his followers to imitate him. The gospel writers offer us numerous opportunities to note the way Jesus behaved in different situations, and to make his behaviour the model for how we act.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The forgiving love of God becomes tangible in the life, ministry and death of Jesus. His death and resurrection sealed a new covenant between God and human beings: I</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18"> give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (John 13:34).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The summary of Jesus’ teaching about how to live is contained in the Sermon on the Mount, and especially in the Beatitudes (Matthew 5:3-12). In the Sermon he showed how his teaching was intended to fulfil the purpose of the old law. He demanded of his disciples that their righteousness must surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees (Matthew 5:20). By this, he meant to show that doing God’s will must go further than mere observance of the Law. He was drawing attention to the negative formulation of the commandments, ‘Thou shalt not’, a formulation which necessarily implies a minimal moral response. The law of Christ invites a much more generous response. The new invitation is to perfection (Matthew 5:48), in other words, to live without setting limits.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Just as Israel was freed from slavery by the power and mercy of God, so the Church, the new Israel, was born out of the life-giving death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. That saving action sets us free from the slavery of sin, to live the life which from the beginning God has intended for us.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">As members of the new Israel, living under the new covenant, we can still learn much from reflecting on that privileged moment in salvation history when God first gave the law to our spiritual ancestors. We learn fundamental attitudes which remain valid for us today. We learn of the love of God which is revealed in the gift of the law to us – God’s own people, and what our attitude ought to be when confronted with this law. In particular, we learn the loving response which God wants to arouse in our hearts when we encounter the gift of God’s law.</span></p>

Luke’s Gospel reports that at the beginning of his ministry Jesus quoted these words from the prophet Isaiah to describe his mission: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favour </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Luke 4:18; Isaiah 61:1).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus proclaimed the good news of salvation. He came so that people could be saved and come to enjoy the freedom of the sons and daughters of God. Salvation means being released and freed from all that oppresses and enslaves. It means being freed from sin, but also from fear, from ignorance, from injustice. It means being enabled to fulfil the potential for which a person was created.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Freedom and the moral law</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">What is the relationship between this freedom and the moral law? This is a relationship which is often misunderstood. One of the reasons for this misunderstanding is a mistaken conception of moral law.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">As we have already seen in the previous section, there is a correspondence between the Law as revealed by God in the Old Testament and what human persons are able to grasp as good, what we call the natural law. This correspondence exists because both are concerned with moral truth. This is why Jesus did not come to abolish ‘the Law’. He could not abolish the truth, but he could deepen our understanding of it.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Moral truth (and hence the moral good) is at the heart of moral law. Moral laws are not something we create ourselves. They are something we discover, or are revealed to us and recognised as true (as in the Old Testament). Moral laws point to the good which is to be protected, promoted and nourished.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This is our starting point for understanding the relationship between law and freedom. St John Paul II discussed this extensively in his encyclical </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">The Splendour of Truth (Veritatis Splendor, nn.35-53). </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">St John Paul II starts off this section as follows:</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">In the Book of Genesis we read: ‘the Lord God commanded the man, saying, “You may eat freely of every tree of the garden; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die” (Genesis 2:16-17)</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">.’</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">With this imagery, Revelation teaches that the power to decide what is good and what is evil does not belong to man, but to God alone. The man is certainly free, inasmuch as he can understand and accept God’s commands. And he possesses an extremely far-reaching freedom, since he can eat ‘of every tree of the garden’. But his freedom is not unlimited: it must halt before ‘the tree of the knowledge of good and evil’, for it is called to accept moral law given by God. In fact, human freedom finds i</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">ts</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18"> authentic and complete fulfilment precisely in the acceptance of that law. God, who alone is good, knows perfectly what is good for man, and by virtue of his very love proposes this good to humans in the commandments. … God’s law does not reduce, much less do away with human freedom; rather, it protects and promotes that freedom.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">As we have already said, it is possible for human reason to grasp something of the moral good, without the assistance of Divine Revelation. But given the effects of fallen human nature Divine Revelation is an effective means of knowing moral truths, even those of the ‘natural order’. So there is no contradiction between Divine Revelation and human reason. Right reason is grounded in Divine truth. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Genuine freedom is an outstanding manifestation of the divine image in the human person. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">God chose that the human person should be responsible for their own response to moral truth. Through our morally good acts we strengthen, develop and consolidate within ourselves our likeness to God. </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">The more one does what is good, the freer one becomes. There is no true freedom except in the service of what is good and just. The choice to disobey and do evil is an abuse of freedom and leads to ‘the slavery of sin’ </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Catechism of the Catholic Church 1733).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Freedom in the moral context is the freedom of the wise person who easily chooses what is truly good for the human person – moved from within by love and understanding. This is the virtuous person. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Behind every moral norm there is a good which that norm protects. The morally mature person acts for love of the good, not simply because they have been taught a moral norm.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This is also what is meant by the ‘new law’ – </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:2). </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">St Thomas Aquinas states that this law: can be called law in two ways. First the law of the spirit is the Holy Spirit … who, dwelling in the soul, not only teaches what it is necessary to do by enlightening the intellect on the things to be done, but also inclines the affections to act with uprightness … Second, the law of the spirit can be called the proper effect of the Holy Spirit, and thus faith working through love which teaches inwardly about the things to be done … and inclines the affection to act. </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(In Epistulum ad Romansanos, c.VIII, lect.1, cited in The Splendour of Truth, no 45). </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This harmony between our knowledge and our affections is the fruit of moral growth and the work of the Spirit.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Led by the Spirit</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Paul tells the Galatians: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Live by the Spirit ... and do not gratify the desires of the flesh</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (5:16). The command, live by the Spirit, that is, ‘act according to the Spirit’, clearly shows that the new life of freedom is a power which must be put into action. It demands actions which must be performed under the influence of the Holy Spirit, flowing from the interior gifts of the Spirit which the Christian possesses. Paul goes on to say that those who are led by the Spirit are not subject to the constraints of any external law dictating to them their duty.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Because they are led by the Spirit, they can distinguish between the works of the flesh (Galatians 5:19-21) and the fruit of the Spirit (5:22-23). The Spirit-guided person instinctively turns aside from the things of the flesh. Having said that, we should not think of this comparison in a wholly dualistic way. A Christian understanding does not see ‘the flesh’ as opposed to ‘the spirit’ in a manner that would suggest that ‘flesh’ is bad and ‘the spirit’ good. Paul’s list of ‘works of the flesh’ includes not only sexual sins (as the term ‘flesh’ has come to suggest), but especially sins against love: enmity, strife, jealousy, anger, selfishness, and other attitudes and behaviours which cause disharmony and are destructive to the broader community.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">If truly led by the Spirit a Christian should spontaneously avoid such works of the flesh. Paul is here giving a list of those sins which the Spirit will help a person avoid, rather than putting forward a code of laws to serve as a basis for Christian living.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Under the heading, ‘the fruit of the Spirit’, love is mentioned in the first place, suggesting that this gift includes all the rest. The one who follows the guidance of the Spirit instinctively practises the other virtues (patience, kindness, faithfulness, etc.), without being aware of the constraint of any law. Basic to Paul’s thinking is the futility of trusting in any law, because no law can give a person the power to overcome sin.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">From what we have seen in Galatians, it should be clear that the Christian freedom which Paul extols is far removed from licentiousness or anarchy. He was well aware, of course, that in this earthly life, a person, even though led and animated by the Spirit, can always lapse, because in this life we are not always filled with the right spirit. We struggle with sinful inclinations. We are never so liberated from the power of sin and the flesh that we cannot fall again under their sway. Our freedom is therefore imperfect. Until we are fully spiritual, we need external laws to help us distinguish between the works of the flesh and the fruits of the Spirit.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In 1 Timothy 1:9, we are told that law is not for the righteous, but for sinners. If we were all righteous, there would be no need of any external laws. For example, Christians who receive the Eucharist every week or even daily, obviously have no need of any law requiring reception of Holy Communion once a year. They are obliged by the law, but they will fulfil it because they are led by the Spirit, not because of the demand of the law.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">But because everyone is a sinner to some extent, external law is necessary either to warn the lapsed that they are no longer following the lead of the Spirit, and so to indicate to them their sinful situation, or to help the faithful to recognise and avoid the works of the flesh. This is why Paul consistently gives moral exhortations and lays down </span><span class="CharOverride-18">rules of conduct. These precepts are intended simply to apply the interior law of the Spirit to the different circumstances of daily life. They all come back ultimately to</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> the one law of love (Galatians 5:14). </span><span class="CharOverride-18">Paul would have</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> been horrified at any suggestion that laws could put a person into a right relationship with God, or that they could ever be the dynamic principle </span><span class="CharOverride-18">of Christian living.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The true motivation</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">It follows that any observance of law which is not motivated by love is seriously flawed. External laws derive whatever value they have from the interior ‘law’ of the Spirit. Mere observance which is empty of love is not an exercise of Christian freedom. On the contrary, Christians who make a code of law the dominant element in their life renounce their freedom and become slaves once again to the law. As St Augustine said: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Whoever avoids evil, not because it is evil but because of a commandment, is not free.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> The free person is the one who avoids evil because it is evil.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">St. Augustine also made the extraordinary comment: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Love, and do what you will.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> Yet, understood properly, this serves as a perfect summary of the Christian’s rule of life. Once genuine love becomes the real motive of a person’s life, then no other law is necessary. She or he has learned to place no limits to the following of Jesus, and has discovered that the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death (Romans 8:2), and that what the Spirit produces is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Paul’s teaching on freedom is therefore not an invitation to self-indulgence or to licentious behaviour, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">you were called to freedom, brothers and sisters; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for self-indulgence, but through love become slaves to one another ... the whole law, </span><span class="CharOverride-18">he says, i</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">s summed up in a single commandment, ‘You shall love your neighbour as yourself’ </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Galatians 5:13-14). Really there is nothing more demanding than the law of love.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Moral life in the Church</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is the Church’s task, through all its members, to continue the mission of Jesus Christ </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">to bring good news to the poor, ... to proclaim release to the captives, ... to let the oppressed go free and to announce that the time has come when the Lord will save his people </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Luke 4:18-19). This is for all members of the Church to do, so that the Church will be seen as a sacrament (a visible and effective sign) of Christ’s presence and activity.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">A question of credibility</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">This task must be performed both by individuals and through the institution. If this witness is lacking at either level, the credibility of the Church suffers. In every aspect of community and institutional life, we must accept love of God and neighbour as the context in which to discover the right way to live. We must be a community in which authority is, and is seen to be, one of service; in which opportunities for real choices exist. Through the institution and individual members, the Church must be an agent of the freedom that salvation brings.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Love of the good must be the basis of the Church’s teaching about morality, the motive for the works of service done in the name of the Church, and the basis for the support given by the Church to both groups and individuals. Pope Francis has written that: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Love trusts, it sets free, it does not try to control, possess and dominate everything. This freedom, which fosters independence, an openness to the world around us and to new experiences, can only enrich and expand relationships</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (The Joy of Love, Amoris Laetitia 115).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Inevitably, the Church must teach in the area of morality for the guidance of her members. This teaching helps us to see our way more clearly and enables us to apply the basic principles to our daily lives. The objective is that we make these principles our own, so that through our moral life the whole community can grow in love. </span></p>

His purpose was to lead     people to God his Father. After his    baptism by John, which marked  the beginning of his relatively brief public ministry, he made his headquarters the town of Capernaum, on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. However, his ministry was a largely itinerant one, and the Gospels tell us that wherever he went, he attracted large crowds of people, to whom he talked about the kingdom of God and about how they might discover the kingdom for themselves.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">From the beginning, the Gospels report, his teaching made a deep impression on people, because he taught with authority, speaking from his personal experience of God his Father. His teaching was often accompanied by acts of healing or other powerful works which gave special weight to his words.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The earliest Gospel, the Gospel of Mark, refers to this authoritative aspect of Jesus’ teaching from the very outset. This is how he describes the beginning of Jesus’ ministry: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">They went to Capernaum; and when the sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and taught. They were astounded at his teaching, for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Mark 1:21-22).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Matthew in his Gospel makes the same comment at the conclusion of the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 7:28-29), and this is appropriate, because the authoritative tone of Jesus’ words is most striking in the Sermon. He presents himself there as the supreme interpreter of God’s will as we noted in the previous chapter.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The first miracle described by Mark is the exorcism of a man with an unclean spirit in the Capernaum synagogue (Mark 1:23-27). Mark concludes his description with the comment: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">They were all amazed, and they kept on asking one another, ‘What is this? A new teaching – with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him’</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (v. 27). Jesus’ calming of the storm at sea evokes a similar reaction: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Mark 4:41).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">An authority shared</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">He also shared his authority with others. When he was sending the Twelve on a missionary tour of the nearby towns and villages, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">he</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">gave them authority over the unclean spirits</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Mark 6:7) and </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Mark 6:13). However, on more than one occasion, Jesus impressed on his disciples that the only acceptable authority in his community was one of service: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Mark 10:43-44). He proposed his own ministry as the model for this concept of authority: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">For the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Mark 10:45).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus’ concept of authority was clearly different from that exercised by secular rulers: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">You know that among the Gentiles those whom they recognise as their rulers lord it over them, and their great ones are tyrants over them. But it is not so among you</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Mark 10:42-43). At his trial before Pilate, he affirmed: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">My kingdom is not from this world</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (John 18:36). His authority was to empower people, to build them up and enable them to lead full lives in union with the Father.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The final act of Jesus before his return to the Father was to commission the Twelve (or the Eleven) disciples to teach in his name. Again from a mountain, he declared: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Matthew 28:18-20).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This is the Church’s fundamental mission. From then until now, the Church has always recognised the duty to teach all nations. The promise, ‘I am with you always’, is a promise given forever. Because the Church is the sacrament of Christ’s continuing presence and activity in the world, it continues to teach with the authority of Christ.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Authority in the Church</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">From the earliest days of the Church, the teaching authority and responsibility of its leaders were clearly recognised. The first writings of the New Testament were the letters of the apostle Paul, and his principal purpose was to teach. He used his letters to instruct, to correct, to guide, to rebuke, to encourage and to remind his converts of what he had taught them when he was with them. The second letter to Timothy, written probably by a disciple of Paul, reminds Timothy of his duty </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">to proclaim the message; be persistent whether the time is favourable or unfavourable; convince, rebuke, and encourage, with the utmost patience in teaching</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (2 Timothy 4:2). This letter, written towards the end of the first century, shows what was expected of the leaders of local churches.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Over the centuries, the Church has exercised its teaching authority mainly through its Councils of bishops. Already in the first century we read in Acts 15 of a gathering of the apostles and elders of the Jerusalem Church (about 50 AD) to settle the difficult question of whether converts from paganism should be obliged to observe the Jewish law.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This Jerusalem assembly of Church leaders is often described as the first Council of the Church. The most recent Council was the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), which was attended by about 2500 bishops from all over the world. This Council was the major event in the Church in recent centuries. It ushered in the greatest development in the life of the Church since the Reformation which took place over 400 years previously. One of the important things to come out of the Council was a renewed vision of the Church, which stressed coresponsibility or shared responsibility for the Church’s mission among all its members.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">We cannot deal with authority and obedience in the Church unless we have a proper understanding of the place of the Bishop of Rome, the Pope. In an earlier session on Peter and his role in the early Church, we touched briefly on the reasons why Catholics acknowledge and respect the Pope as the successor of Peter among the bishops, and the visible leader of Christ’s Church on earth. From the early centuries, the authority and leadership of the Roman Church was recognised by most of the Catholic world. When the church in Jerusalem died out at the end of the first century, the church of Rome began to take precedence. This was because it had been visited and taught by both Peter and Paul, and was the place of their martyrdom. From the second century onwards, it came to claim and receive a primacy over the other local churches, and was acknowledged as the centre of unity and the adjudicator of doctrinal and disciplinary disputes. Over time, the primacy of the church of Rome came to be extended to its bishop. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Of course, Jesus Christ himself, working through his Spirit, is the real leader of the Church. All human authority only represents him, and is his instrument. The Pope as Bishop of Rome, along with all the bishops throughout the world are known as ‘vicars of Christ’ or ‘representatives’ of Jesus Christ’s leadership. Under the leadership of the Bishop of Rome (the Pope), the whole college of bishops have responsibility for governing Christ’s Church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The ‘collegiality’ or coresponsibility of the Pope and the other bishops for teaching and guiding the Church is most clearly shown by a gathering of a general Council, such as Vatican II. These gatherings of the bishops of the world in union with the Pope are called by him, presided over by him, and their decrees have to be approved by him.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">One of the fruits of the Second Vatican Council was the ‘synod’ of bishops, a smaller number of representatives of the hierarchy, elected by the national groups of bishops around the world. They meet with the Pope on a regular basis, to discuss and make decisions on important issues affecting the universal Church.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading ParaOverride-47">Infallibility</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">A doctrine of the Church which has been the object of much discussion over the past century has been its infallibility. Basically, this means that the Church claims to have the God-given power and authority to teach the truth. It refers to Christ’s guidance of the Church through the Holy Spirit, so that the Church cannot fall into error when teaching his message.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is important to realise that the gift of infallibility belongs to the Church as a whole, for the Spirit of the Lord fills the Church and illumines the faith of all. In the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church (Gaudium et spes), the bishops of the Second Vatican Council declared: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">the entire body of the faithful, anointed as they are by the Holy Spirit, ... cannot err in matters of belief </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(no. 12).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In other words when the people of God as a whole believes a certain truth of faith, or as Vatican II puts it, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">when they manifest a universal consent in matters of faith and/or morals,</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> this is itself a guarantee of truth. In the history of the Church it can be shown that sometimes the people have expressed the faith better than their leaders. In the early centuries, the faith of the common people was largely responsible for preserving the truth about the nature of the divinity of Christ, when their leaders were silent or divided. Blessed John Henry Cardinal Newman (1801-1890) remarked that for a time the deposit of faith passed into the hands of the laity.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The gift of infallibility belongs also to the bishops of the Church, the successors of the apostles. Jesus assured the Twelve as a group, and Peter in particular: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Matthew 16:19; 18:18). He also told them, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">whoever listens to you listens to me</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Luke 10:16), and his final promise was to be with them </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">always, to the end of the age</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Matthew 28:20). He promised he would send them the Spirit of truth, to be with them forever (John 14:16-17).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The bishops have the responsibility to teach, and as a college, in union with the Pope and the whole people of God, they are guided by the Holy Spirit in their teaching. They express the faith of the Church for acceptance by the people of God. While they usually exercise their solemn teaching office when gathered together for a general Council, their individual day to day teaching also has particular (known as ‘ordinary’) authority.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Papal infallibility</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Within the college of bishops and the Church as a whole, the Pope as successor of Peter occupies a unique position. The doctrine of the infallibility of the Pope was not formally defined until 1870, at the first (and unfinished) Vatican Council. Although it took more than eighteen centuries for the doctrine to be clearly formulated, or for its solemn proclamation to be considered necessary, it can be traced from the early centuries as a part of the developing concept of papal authority.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is important to recognise that there has been and still is a development of doctrine within the Church, that is, a deepening of understanding and clearer expression of the teachings handed on by Christ. Although the Church’s basic teachings cannot be changed or denied, their formulation can grow, develop and change to express the truth more clearly, or in language more acceptable to contemporary men and women.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">When the bishops of the Catholic world met with Pope Pius IX for the first Vatican Council in 1870, they stated that in certain circumstances the Pope himself has the authority solemnly to express the faith of the Church. He does so only in specific circumstances when he is speaking on a matter of faith or morality, and when he makes it clear that he intends to use his authority in such a way as to call on the people of God for their faithful obedience to this defined truth, as part of what God has revealed. The technical term for this exercise of papal authority is that the Pope on such occasions speaks ‘ex cathedra’, that is, from the chair, the chair of Peter.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">St John Paul II has said: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">To believe in the infallibility of the Church does not mean – in any way – to believe in the infallibility of man, but to believe in the gift of Christ; in that gift which allows fallible men to proclaim infallibly and to confess infallibly the truth revealed for our salvation.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Papal infallibility thus reflects in its teaching the faith of the whole Church. The Pope listens to the Church through all the means available to discover the true faith of the Church: prayer, study, consultation, deliberation. He does not receive private revelations, but neither does he need to take an opinion poll. He listens to the memory of the Church, the long Tradition of faith as held and expressed over the centuries. In his teaching he in turn, as chief pastor of the Church, expresses the faith of the whole community, in continuity with the Tradition of the Church and as a development of that Tradition. In its earliest understanding, infallibility was understood as a form of accountability. Popes were bound by the teaching that they have received and could not deviate from the foundations on which the Church was built. It was ther</span><span class="CharOverride-18">efore not seen as a personal gift but as a strength and safeguard to preserving the faith of the Church. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Christians still depend on the power of the Holy Spirit promised by Christ to his followers to guide them to the truth. The teaching Church proposes the truth of God’s revelation for our assent. The first duty of the Christian in relation to the teaching Church is to listen, because even though the Church’s voice may not always be clear, the gift of infallibility ensures that the Spirit does speak through the Church.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Listening is an active quality, which involves a willingness to change and thereby grow, even if this means abandoning some long-held and cherished ideas. Part of the listening process is prayerful discussion and reflection with others, allowing time for the teaching to take root and for its full meaning to become apparent.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading ParaOverride-47">Individual conscience</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">One of the fruits of active listening is the development of one’s conscience. Conscience is the faculty we have of judging right from wrong, and as such is the most important guide to living that we have. At the end of the day, our absolute obligation is to obey our conscience. This important principle was enunciated by the second Vatican Council: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">In all his activity, a person is bound to follow his conscience faithfully ... according to truly Christian values and principles.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> This means that there is always a prior obligation to do all we can to ensure that our conscience is properly formed. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The process by which we come to moral decisions is a complex one that is very difficult to analyse. It depends on a whole sum of experience which includes inherited values (upbringing), knowledge of law and history (instruction), the influence of others (personal relationships), the influence of society (including school, peer groups, internet, the media and the Church), one’s grasp of the gospel and response to Christ (faith), one’s awareness of God (prayer), plus the experience we have of making decisions, both right and wrong, and every aspect of personal growth. No one can ever say that one’s conscience is completely formed. We all have the duty to listen, reflect and pray, so that we may grow constantly in sensitivity to God’s will for us.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">For a Catholic, where religious and moral matters are concerned, the teaching of Christ and of the Church should be uppermost in the forming of one’s conscience. The whole teaching of the gospel and the way it is understood in the Church is a major formative influence. If a person is brought up in a committed Christian family and environment, he or she shares in and is shaped by the conscience of the Church, the Church’s evaluation of human life. The Church forms in that person a Christian conscience, which enables him or her to assess things according to the mind of Christ himself.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Christian’s assent to the Church’s teaching is therefore an activity guided by the Holy Spirit, whereby we conscientiously come to grasp the truth as revealed by God. It is a process which is for some easy and almost instinctive; for others, it can be a slow, laborious and very complex process. Each one of us comes to faith in a different way according to the grace which is given to us.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Degrees of authority</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Obviously, not all the Church’s teachings have the same importance or binding force. There is an extensive area of Church teaching which does not come under the category of ‘infallible’. This teaching of the Pope and bishops is called the ‘ordinary’ teaching of the Church. It is often communicated by decrees of Roman church departments, or by papal encyclicals (letters from the Pope to the whole Church on important issues). </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This raises the question to what extent Catholics are bound to obey the ordinary non-infallible teaching of the Church. The Second Vatican Council acknowledged this distinction. In the case of infallible teaching, it states that the assent which Catholics must give is the ‘assent of faith’. In the case of ordinary teaching, it speaks of the </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">religious submission of mind and will.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The principle is clear that Catholics are to follow the guidance of the Pope and bishops in religious matters, even when they are not teaching infallibly. They must always have due respect for the Church’s teaching. In accordance with their capacity, they should take the trouble to discover what the Church teaches and why. They should pray, consult (a priest or other informed Catholic) and consider the options carefully.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">‘Religious submission of mind and will’ requires the renouncing of any attitude of obstinacy in one’s opinion, at the same time adopting an attitude of docility to the teaching in question. Renouncing obstinacy means rejecting any tendency to close one’s mind to the Church’s teaching or refusing even to give it a fair hearing. Docility is a willingness to be taught, a willingness to accept another’s judgement over one’s own when it is reasonable to do so. It calls for an open attitude towards the Church’s teaching, giving it a fair hearing, doing one’s best to appreciate the reasons in its favour, so as to leave oneself open to conviction about the truth and thus to be able to assent to it. A person without these attitudes can hardly be said to be acting in good conscience.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">A free obedience</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Not every teaching of the Church carries the same weight. The doctrine of the Trinity is of greater importance than teachings on the practice of fasting, for example. Debates about the nature of liturgical translations are not the same as debates about the nature of Eucharist itself. There are areas of the Church’s life which are so central, that to completely dissent would seriously place into question one’s relationship to the Church. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">However, it may happen in some instances, after serious consideration, sincere soul-searching, attempts to understand the Church’s teaching and an openness to being taught, a Catholic is unable before God to assent in good conscience to this or that particular teaching of the Church, and believes that in view of his or her special circumstances, he or she can be exempt from the precepts of the teaching. Such a person cannot be accused of a lack of obedience or respect, and in the case of the Church’s ordinary teaching, need not consider that conscientious dissent cuts him or her off from the sacramental life of the Church. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Often a problem arises because a teaching of the Church is explained poorly or inadequately, and this can be remedied through honest and sincere dialogue. The role of well-formed pastors and lay ministers is essential in these circumstances. The pastoral responsibility of parish leaders is three-fold: firstly to accurately present the Church’s teaching; secondly, to clarify the centrality or otherwise of the Church’s teaching in question (is the concern with the teaching on the Trinity or a disagreement with a bishop’s comments on social issues or questions of personal morality); and thirdly, having listened carefully to the voice of the Church, the questioner is guided to consider their particular circumstance in the light of their conscience. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In the end, the final decision for acceptance or dissent in good conscience, lies with the individual. No one can compel assent. It is also important to remember that those who struggle in an honest and sincere way with some aspect of the Church’s formal teaching can be the catalyst for further development or clarification of Church teaching. Nor does the inability to accept a formal teaching in the present preclude the possibility of acceptance at another stage of one’s faith journey. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Finally, we may recall what we have said earlier about leadership in the Church being a leadership of service. Christ taught and showed his followers how to use their authority by being the servants of others. Pope and bishops therefore know they are called to be leaders in service. They try to be aware of, to judge, and to use the gifts that are distributed by the Spirit throughout the members of the Church. They know that many of the most important movements within the Church have been initiated by the Spirit among priests or lay people, and only later have come to their attention. For this reason, they should engage in a continual dialogue with their people, and be open to the Spirit who often speaks through the gifts of others. Recent popes, conscious of their call from Christ to lead by means of service of the people, have revived the title, ‘the servant of the servants of God’.</span></p>

By that phrase Marx meant to convey that the Christian faith was intended to keep the flock content with their situation, no matter what injustices they might suffer.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Our answer to that smear is to point out that Jesus’ message was not just one of a reward in the life to come, for patient acceptance of suffering and injustice in this world. He was also very concerned with the welfare of each and every person – both body and soul – in this life, as well as in the next. To be faithful to the gospel, we too need to be concerned about disadvantaged, oppressed and exploited people, about their material as well as their spiritual welfare.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">The Old Testament vision</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">A correct appreciation of the teaching of Jesus about poverty and affluence depends to some extent on the Old Testament background to his ministry, for his language and many of his ideas were based on those writings, which for him and his Jewish contemporaries represented the word of God. The Old Testament perspective on poverty is not uniform, and sometimes ambiguous. There are some passages which indicate that material prosperity is a divine blessing, while poverty sometimes implies a punishment from God.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">However, we must be aware of the limited horizons of the faith of ancient Israel, when there was no clear idea of any life or transcendent destiny beyond the present earthly existence. In the absence of any clear concept of an after-life, or final reward and punishment, divine favour and disfavour were often conceived and expressed in terms of this world and a person’s observed status: health, prosperity, long life and numerous descendants as signs of human virtue and God’s blessing and reward; while the opposite were seen as signs of God’s disfavour or punishment.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">But even within this restricted framework, this narrow idea of divine justice is by no means typical of what the Old Testament has to say about poverty and the poor. In general, poverty is considered as an evil, because it causes undesirable relationships of oppression on the one hand and dependence on the other. It is seen as an abnormal situation, and one that needs correction.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">With regard to wealth, the Old Testament in general sees its possession as acceptable if it is used to satisfy the needs of the less privileged in society. However, the unnecessary accumulation of worldly goods is severely judged, because this constitutes a challenge to the lordship of the God of Israel, and suggests a lack of faith and trust in God. Wealth is often linked with injustice, because the rich are often guilty of oppression of the poor, their wealth is frequently a source of pride, and the false security which it breeds turns its possessors away from trust in God.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The prophet Amos is scathing on those who trample on the poor ... and push aside the needy (5:11,12). He calls the people of Israel to let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream (5:24).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">God’s option for the poor</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Being reduced to a state of dependence, the poor are encouraged to be dependent on God. Since they were in a subordinate position, often oppressed and enslaved by others, whatever they received was not the result of their demands for they had no power, but solely the result of their successful appeals or pleas for mercy. One can easily see how this concept of the powerlessness of poverty took on a spiritual dimension. It was an easy step to seeing humility and weakness as favourable dispositions for being open to the saving activity of God, God’s liberating action and saving justice. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Whereas the rich person was self-sufficient, having amassed such wealth and power as no longer to feel the need to be dependent on anyone, God included, the poor on the other hand, with no worldly goods to support them or any worldly influence to count on, look to God alone as the only possible hope of liberation, the one alone who could give them justice. This comes up again and again in the psalms, the great prayers of Israel.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This spiritual or religious view of poverty came to the fore in the last few centuries before Christ, because Israel’s history had been one of sad experience of the futility of pinning its hopes on kings and rulers. The ordinary religious people, who were predominantly poor, were those who waited on the Lord in a spirit of expectancy, in an attitude of spiritual childhood and humility, open to receiving whatever God had to offer. It was ideas such as these which laid the basis for the idea of the ‘faithful remnant’ of Israel, the ones who would experience God’s salvation. Faithfulness to the Lord meant waiting patiently for God’s coming in all humility and poverty. It was among these that messianic hope was strongest. Typical examples of this category at the time of Jesus were the pious and elderly Simeon and Anna, who are described in Luke’s Gospel as looking for the consolation and redemption of Israel (Luke 2:25-38). Mary must also be included among them, as seen by the outlook expressed by her in her ‘Magnificat’ (Luke 1:46-55).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This spiritual, religious view of poverty did not exclude the physical or economic aspects, but it somehow transcended them. However, although such a spiritualising of poverty might appear to some to smack of the ‘opium of the people’ syndrome, it did not mean that the poor simply became resigned to their fate, and accepted the scandal of poverty and injustice in their lives, while waiting passively for some divine intervention. It did mean that their first priority was to address themselves to God whom they saw as their ultimate source of hope and justice and who they believed would come to save them.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The voice of the prophets</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">At the same time, the tradition of the prophets remained alive, those who worked to bring about reforms in the life of the people and to attack the basic causes of poverty. The prophets passionately denounced poverty as an evil – the consequence of the injustice of the powerful. They were not prepared to admit it was the result of chance or blind fate. Men like Isaiah, Jeremiah and Amos pleaded for a just society according to the ideals of the covenant. They saw the condition of the poor as an attack on the solidarity of the people of God, and paid particular attention to the plight of slaves, widows and orphans, beggars and the disinherited. For the prophets, acceptance of poverty and the unjust structures which caused it, meant a regression to the people’s pre-Exodus condition of slavery in Egypt.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">But the prophetic message was not just a series of negative denunciations. Their criticism of the status quo was intended to alert people to what needed to be changed. (They attacked the excessive accumulation of wealth, because they saw the exploitation which accompanied and followed such unrestrained activity.)</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">An important and positive part of the prophetic message was the announcement of God’s will – what they believed God wanted to see take place in human history. The struggle against poverty was therefore conceived as collaboration with God in implementing God’s plan for God’s people. The Jewish people were called to join in God’s action to correct injustices and establish righteousness on earth. Seeking to eradicate poverty was seen as a sign of one’s fidelity to God. Realism however led to the recognition that those who would take up this struggle would be precisely those who had practical experience of what it meant to be poor. It was this experience which led many men and women in Israel to adopt an attitude of humble dependence on God, and of trust in God’s grace. This was not because they idealised poverty, or saw it as having any value of blessing in itself. But poverty did take on for them a definite religious significance; it called on them to open themselves to God, and prepared them to receive God’s gifts. Though their needs were often very worldly, the poor were still the ones most ready to receive the Messiah (Christ) into their homes and into their hearts.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">Jesus: ‘good news <br />to the poor’</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">This outline of the Old Testament approach to poverty and the poor sets the scene for the arrival of Jesus on the world’s stage. Jesus was introduced to the people by John the Baptist, whose own message of the need for repentance included the demand of charity to the poor, as a preparation for receiving the Messiah. In concrete terms, he demanded that people share their food and clothing with those who had none; that tax collectors must </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">collect no more than their due</span><span class="CharOverride-18">; soldiers must </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">rob no-one by violence or by false accusation </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Luke 3:10-14). Later on, when John sent a delegation to ask Jesus if he was the one that was expected, Jesus answered in terms which confirmed John’s requirements: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">the blind receive their sight; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; the dead are raised up; and the poor have good news preached to them </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Luke 7:22).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">So Jesus clearly indicated that he saw mission to the poor as an essential part of proclaiming the kingdom of God. Luke’s Gospel is sometimes referred to as the Gospel of social justice. In Luke’s Gospel the first recorded words of Jesus after he began his ministry were a quote from the prophet Isaiah: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Luke 4:18-19). </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">By adding the words, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing </span><span class="Italic CharOverride-18">(Luke 4:21)</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">, </span><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus emphasised that his ministry would give a privileged place to the poor and the disadvantaged, and announce to them hope of relief from their sufferings.</span></p>

			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">He says that as a result of his coming they are specially blessed for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them. We have here a continuation of the Old Testament idea that because they have nothing, the poor are more likely to be open to the saving activity of Jesus, and thus more prepared to receive his promise of salvation.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus’ teaching was obviously a source of hope for the poor. First it foreshadowed an end to their misery. Secondly, his proclamation of the kingdom implied that God’s judgement was at hand, and divine judgement implied in turn that justice would be done. The very term ‘kingdom of God’ conjured up the image of the ideal king, whose duty it would be to administer justice among his subjects, guaranteeing the rights of the weak and defenceless in the face of the rich and powerful, at the same time repressing these who threatened the rights of the poor.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This vision helps to explain the popularity of the preaching of Jesus among the crowds of ordinary people who followed him.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus could declare the poor to be blessed or happy, because the apparent fulfilment of their messianic hopes in him must have inspired happiness in them. But if their poverty and oppression did not immediately disappear, would not such declarations be destined to lead to disappointment and even despair? There must then be a further reason for his description of the poor as happy or blessed. However, we should not imagine that Jesus intended the poor to resign themselves to their condition, on the grounds that later, in the kingdom, the injustice would be rectified. The words of Jesus invite not resignation, but hope. The kingdom of God is something which broke into history in a new and decisive way in the ministry of Jesus. The elimination of the exploitation and poverty that prevents the poor from being fully human has begun, with the proclamation of a kingdom of justice that will put an end to their misery. Poverty is an evil, and therefore incompatible with the kingdom of God, which is intended to bring happiness to all those living in unhappiness and misfortune. They are the ones meant to benefit most from the new era of salvation inaugurated by Jesus.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The role of the Church</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The words ‘begun’ and ‘inaugurated’, are important for there was an incompleteness about Jesus’ ministry and mission, in the sense that a community of disciples, a Church, was formed to carry on his work. Although he promised to remain with us always, it is the Church which is called to be the continuing sign of his saving presence and activity in the world, and a means, the most important means, of bringing God’s kingdom of justice to fulfilment. The Church is not the kingdom of God; it is God’s instrument for the advancement and the ultimate revelation of the kingdom. But obviously, the values which the Church espouses and makes her own must be the values of the kingdom, if we are to be faithful to the will of Christ.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Church must therefore identify with the poor, as he did. It is not just a matter of recognising the poor as an important part of the world, but the Church must recognise itself in the poor, so that the poor can recognise Christ in the Church. Unless this state of affairs is verified, the Church loses its own identity and fails to be fully the Church. To neglect this fundamental fact is equivalent to ignoring Christ’s birth in poverty and his life of poverty, and the whole tremendous mystery of the Incarnation.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus’ attitude to the rich</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The other side of the coin is the attitude and message of Jesus to the rich. We know there were people of high social status who listened and responded to his preaching, although they were not members of his closest group of disciples. This indicates that Jesus did not give up on the rich, or reject them, but rather he challenged them in various ways to follow the paths of justice, and be converted. However, his message was extremely tough for those who placed their hopes in wealth. In Luke’s Gospel he implied that they were fools (Luke 12:16-21) since wealth cannot justify a person in God’s sight, especially when it is not accompanied by social responsibility. This latter point is made most effectively in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31). In the passage which comes just before this parable, Jesus spells out his own position in relation to wealth: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">No slave can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate the one and love the other, or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Luke 16:13). </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This saying of Jesus is also found in Matthew’s Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 6:24) and is followed by his recommendation to trust in God’s righteousness, and all other needs will be satisfied. Here again we have another allusion to the ‘poor of Israel’s God’, who set their sights on the fulfilment of God’s promises, and do not put their trust in earthly possessions.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">A radical call</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The radical nature of Jesus’ message is seen in his challenge to those who aspired to be his disciples. He asked them in no uncertain terms to give up unconditionally their attachment to wealth, allowing no degrees or reservations: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">So therefore, none of you can become my disciple if you do not give up all your possessions </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Luke 14:33). A powerful example of this is the story of the rich young man who approached Jesus wanting to become his disciple. When the young man found himself unable to accept the challenge to sell all he had and give the proceeds to the poor, Jesus commented to his disciples: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">How hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Mark 10:23). When the disciples showed their amazement at these words, he said it was easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The demand to the rich man to share his wealth with the poor was intended to be a sign of his commitment to the kingdom of justice. The rejection of worldly wealth, in favour of those who had none, would be a clear sign that a fundamental change had taken place in the rich man’s heart. Instead of concentrating greedily on himself, he would now practise responsibility towards the underprivileged. This change meant conversion from self-sufficiency to an attitude of total dependence on God and God’s kingdom, and commitment to Jesus, the one who proclaimed it.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The call of Jesus goes to the very heart of things. Its radical nature eliminated candidates who wanted to be disciples but were not sufficiently prepared to follow one who had nowhere to lay his head. It is not that poverty is proposed as a blessing or an ideal in itself, but voluntary acceptance will show that a person is ready to share the life of those who hope in the love and justice of God. We are thus called to identify with Jesus himself, and his voluntary acceptance of a humble status and the role of a servant, sharing what we have with the poor, because only thus can we live according to the gospel.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Renunciation of the goods of this world is not an escape from the world. It does not mean turning one’s back on the good things the world has to offer, or denying oneself the enjoyment of them. It is rather a detachment from worldly possessions which is linked positively with the commandment of love. As Jesus told his disciples: ‘If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me’ (Matthew 16:24).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Of course the Gospel acknowledges that a person’s material needs must be met. Jesus warned that man does not live by bread alone, but that implies he cannot live without bread. He told his disciples to pray</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">: Give us this day our daily bread.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> But to ask for bread today does not mean wanting more bread than is necessary, especially if the accumulation of wealth means that others will go without their daily bread.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">There is a danger in over-simplifying the teaching of Jesus, by saying that following Christ is the equivalent of being poor. We have seen how Matthew substitutes ‘poor in spirit’ for Luke’s simple designation of the poor. Unfortunately not every poor person is poor in spirit. One who is materially poor can also be proud, avaricious and intolerant. Material poverty is not a blessing, however there is certainly a connection between poverty and poverty of spirit in the sight of God. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">At the same time, of course, a claim to spiritual poverty can also be a sham, unless there is a real interior disposition towards, and identification with, the physically poor. The path which Jesus indicates that we must follow is therefore not poverty for its own sake, but charity. It is a life of love, which necessarily takes the form of charity towards the needy – and solidarity with the poor and exploited.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">An act of love</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Poverty is a relative term. There is no virtue in absolute poverty, where the basic necessities of life of water, food and shelter are unavailable. Religious or voluntary poverty means living life with basic simplicity and necessity. Voluntary acceptance of poverty is, therefore, an act of love. Just as the real cause of people’s exploitation and alienation is selfishness, so the deepest reason for voluntary poverty is love of neighbour. Christian poverty has meaning only as a commitment of solidarity with the poor, those who suffer misery and injustice. The commitment is to witness to the evil that has resulted from sin and destroys communion. Because of this solidarity, we can help the poor and exploited to become aware of exploitation and seek liberation from it. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The challenge of poverty to the Church should provoke an attitude of witness and action of a prophetic character: an announcement of the justice of God and a denunciation of human injustice. It is not something that can be expressed just by words, but by a way of living. The rejection of riches out of love for one’s neighbour is a sign of total acceptance of Jesus and of openness to the kingdom of justice which he proclaimed.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">The ‘newness’ <br />of Jesus’ gospel</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The teaching and activity of Jesus reveal a definite advance on the Old Testament outlook. First of all, there is no New Testament echo of those Old Testament passages which suggest material prosperity is a sign of God’s favour. Secondly, in the Old Testament, wealth is seen as something which can be an obstacle to any real commitment to God’s justice, but the alternative proposed by Jesus is not found there. Some of the prophets like Jeremiah pointed the way to what Jesus would propose, but we do not find in the Old Testament any explicit invitation to renounce the accumulation of wealth or to adopt the attitude and lifestyle of poverty. The other advance is of course the example of Jesus himself, who called on his disciples to imitate his example of humbling himself, taking on the form of a servant (Philippians 2:6-8), and becoming poor (2 Corinthians 8:9).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It also becomes clearer from Jesus’ teaching that God is not the cause of the injustice which produces the material poverty of the majority of human beings. It cannot be said that God decides or condones that some will be rich and others poor. There is in the world a clear disparity in the distribution of the products of human labour and the world’s resources, but that cannot be attributed to God’s will. Jesus makes it clear that it is the rich who run the greater risk of God’s judgement. Hence, his radical demand that the rich young man, who wanted to be his disciple, should dispose of his possessions and give the proceeds to the poor.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Poverty is not extolled as a state of life for its own sake. It remains an evil in the sight of God, something He wants to see eradicated, and this is why Jesus attacks the accumulation of wealth by the rich. They are condemned because their activity seems to indicate they place more trust in the abundance of material possessions than in God. If this is the case, their attitude becomes one of idolatry, because they worship Mammon (wealth) rather than God.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The gospel message is that, although the poor are declared to be happy or blessed or privileged, they are also the unfortunate who must be helped. No other New Testament passage makes this more clear than the famous passage of Matthew 25:31-46, where Jesus paints a dramatic picture of the final judgement. The hungry, the thirsty, the stranger, the naked, the sick and the prisoner are identified with Jesus. They are his brothers and sisters. What is done to them is done to him. This text warns all those who aspire to follow Christ to remain on the alert to recognise his presence at all times, and to serve him by serving the poor.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This passage is of vital importance to our understanding of the Church. It even defines our faithfulness to Jesus Christ. His earthly existence was a clear demonstration of what it was to be really poor. As a result, the poor were able to have confidence in him, could see in him the seeds of hope, and hear in his teaching the expression of justice and love. So must it be with the Church. Just as Jesus centred his heart on ‘the poor’ in his midst, so too must the Church continually centre its heart on the impoverished, needy and vulnerable. It must do so in word and deed. Anything less is a betrayal of the gospel. </span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The social gospel</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">A prevalent misunderstanding of the Christian gospel is that faith is a purely personal, private matter, between each person and God, to the exclusion of everyone and everything else. The gospel is not just a matter of accepting Jesus as one’s personal Lord and Saviour – the slogan of the fundamentalist, evangelical churches. The message Jesus left us is one of the need for care and concern for one another, and if necessary, to work to correct the wrongs and injustices done to others, and to change the structures responsible for them. Christian love demands this. There is no private way to God that ignores the needs of others. There can be no authentic acceptance of Jesus as one’s personal Lord and Saviour, if it is deaf to the cries of the poor. Concern for social justice is close to the heart of the gospel message.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The idea that the Church should concern itself only with spiritual things and not become involved in human needs and concerns is fairly common in our society.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">We have heard the line many times in recent years, that the Church’s task is to preach the gospel and to save people’s souls, and not meddle in matters that do not concern it. Another variation of this theme is that religion is a very good thing in its right place, but business is business.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">All worldly rulers and politicians claim that their main purpose is to serve their constituents and cater for all their needs. This is often a sham, and for this reason it is the Church’s role to be a constant critic of secular power and authority and its misuse. The Church must be the voice of those who are left behind and who do not have access to the most basic opportunities in society.</span></p>

			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus declared before Pilate that his kingdom was not of this world (John 18:36). We live in the world, but we must not be of the world; that is, we should not take our values from secular society. To live in the world and at the same time to be part of the community of Jesus means to avoid accepting the world’s upside-down values. However, it does not mean escaping from the world, or dropping out of society. Christians should be politically involved. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Our world desperately needs Christian men and women who are prepared to become involved in politics and other social organisations and aspire to positions of influence and leadership in order to carry their Christian values into the market place. Among those Christian values must be firstly surrendering to God and putting God first in our lives.

			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">There is a passage in the Gospels that relates the story of a poor widow who gave her last cent as a contribution to the temple of Jerusalem. Jesus called the attention of the disciples to her action. He seems to speak in admiration of her generosity and her sacrifice, comparing it with the offerings of the rich who contributed no more that they could afford. Their contribution did not hurt them at all: they would not even miss what they gave, whereas she donated everything she had (Mark 12:41-44).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This picture of the widow as a figure of admiration, and an example of generosity and self-sacrifice, is the traditional way of understanding this episode. But there is another way. Immediately prior to the story of the widow, Jesus was castigating the scribes, the religious leaders for – among others things – </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">they devour widows’ houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Mark 12:40). As well as being religious leaders, the scribes were also civil lawyers. Jesus’ attack on them suggests they had a reputation for exploiting widows after the death of their husbands, and fleecing them of their inheritance and their property.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">After this denunciation, Jesus sees the widow giving a small offering, something she could not really afford, to the Temple. He points out her action to the disciples, but the Gospel does not really say whether he was impressed, or admired her action, or whether he was sad or angry. Was he perhaps really expressing his anger that one of those who had already suffered so much at the hands of dishonest and unscrupulous lawyers, was now contributing the little amount she had left to the religious establishment?</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">If we take this second interpretation of the story as a more valid, or equally valid one, we are reminded again that Jesus was not just someone who taught his followers to be humble and self-sacrificing, but also one who was concerned about social justice, about poverty, about the exploitation of the poor by the rich.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The clear implication is that the Church, comprising those who claim to be his followers, must also be concerned about the inequalities and injustices in our society today.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Justice and the Church’s social teaching</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par ParaOverride-52"><span class="Emphasis CharOverride-18">Social justice is a central dimension of the proclamation of the gospel. The Church’s social teaching touches upon almost every area of our collective contemporary life. Its basis is founded in the God-given human dignity of each person. Every person is created in the image of God. The four pillars or principles upon wh</span><span class="Emphasis CharOverride-18">i</span><span class="Emphasis CharOverride-18">ch Catholic social justice teaching rests are: </span></p>
			<p class="_8-Numbered ParaOverride-52"><span class="Emphasis CharOverride-18">1.&#9;human dignity; </span></p>
			<p class="_8-Numbered ParaOverride-52"><span class="Emphasis CharOverride-18">2.&#9;a focus on the common good; </span></p>
			<p class="_8-Numbered ParaOverride-52"><span class="Emphasis CharOverride-18">3.&#9;subsidiarity (a principle that holds that a higher unit of society should not do what a lower unit can do as well); and </span></p>
			<p class="_8-Numbered ParaOverride-52"><span class="Emphasis CharOverride-18">4.&#9;solidarity (a recognition of our common humanity and need for mutuality, and the strength of community).  </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Each individual is connected to the broader human family and therefore social organisation and the common good are essential elements of Catholic social teaching. Every human person needs to have their rights protected and be given the opportunity to grow in freedom, dignity and love. </span><span class="CharOverride-7">(continued p 216)</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Rights also correspond to responsibilities and Catholic social teaching recognises the responsibilities that individuals have to other human beings, their families and broader society. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">As was said by Pope Paul VI, the true test of a society is how it treats its most vulnerable members. The poor and vulnerable have a particular moral claim on the conscience of any society. Special concern for the poor is a gospel imperative, not only because that is where Christ is to be found, but also because it serves the requirements of human dignity and helps create a healthy and compassionate society. We are called to look at political, social and economic decisions and ask, ‘How do they affect the poor?’ The ‘option for the poor,’ is not a slogan of class struggle or revolution. Rather it upholds Christ’s special concern for those on the edges of society and recognises that the deprivation and powerlessness of any individual or group wounds the whole community.</span></p>

This social teaching of the Church aligns our spiritual conversion with our care of creation:</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">The ecological crisis is … a summons to profound interior conversion … whereby the effects of [our] encounter with Jesus Christ becomes evident in [our] relationship with the world around [us]. Living our vocation to be protectors of God’s handiwork is essential to a life of virtue; it is not an optional or a secondary aspect of our Christian experience</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (217).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Since the beginning of the new millennium, numerous papal and Church statements have emphasised the need to re-interpret and re-define the relationship between human beings and their environment. In 2004, the Bishops of Queensland wrote a pastoral letter on the Great Barrier Reef called </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Let the Coastlands be Glad</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> – a reference to psalm 97. At the beginning of this letter, the bishops summed-up well the conversion of heart that has taken place in recent decades: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Care for the environment and a keener ecological awareness have become key moral issues for the Christian conscience. The Holy Spirit is clearly guiding us into a deeper sense of companionship and care in regard to all the varied forms of life on planet Earth. </span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">‘… It was good’</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The starting point for a Christian understanding of creation is that God is the creator of all things, and creates out of the depths of love. The constant refrain of the opening chapter of Genesis (the first book of the Bible) is that God looked upon creation and </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">saw that it was good.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> Creation is an act of self-revelation from a free and loving God. God then entrusts the whole of creation to Adam (man) and Eve (woman), the first human beings, and only then does God rest from the work of creation (Genesis 2:3). Adam and Eve’s call to share in God’s creative work brings into play those abilities and gifts which distinguish them from all other creatures. At the same time, their call establishes a fixed relationship between humanity and the rest of creation.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The sin of Adam and Eve causes not only their alienation from God and each other but also distorts their relationship with the earth itself. To summarise the words of Pope Benedict XVI, once we set ourselves up in place of God instead of acting as God’s coworker, we end-up </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">provoking a rebellion on the part of nature </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(creation). </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Not only is the story of Adam and Eve a typical story of humanity’s relationship with God as a whole, it is also as a typical story of humanity’s relationship with God’s creation as a whole.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Genesis 1:27 states that God’s plan was to create man and woman in God’s image and likeness. That is, it was God’s plan that man and woman should exercise this dominion (Genesis 2:15) with wisdom and love and as stewards of God’s creation. Pope Francis points out that this ‘dominion’ is never interpreted as absolute for this can lead to </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">the unbridled exploitation of nature </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(On Care of Our Common Home 67). While Genesis signifies the bountiful gift of God’s creation, the Jewish understanding of this gift always implies responsibilities and right relationships with God, others and the whole of creation: </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">The biblical texts are to be read in their context … recognizing that they tell us to ‘till and keep’ the garden of the world (cf. Genesis 2:15). ‘Tilling’ refers to cultivating, ploughing or working, while ‘keeping’ means caring, protecting, overseeing and preserving. This implies a relationship of mutual responsibility between human beings and nature</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (67).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The suffering earth</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">As far back as 1971, Pope Paul VI warned of the dangers of exploiting and destroying the environment. Pope Paul VI pointed out that </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">by ill-considered exploitation of nature, human beings risk destroying it and the human family in turn becomes the victim of this degradation. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">St John Paul II built on this observation and spoke of a </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">suffering earth. </span><span class="CharOverride-18">He appealed to Paul’s precious insight in Romans 8:19-22 where Paul tells us that creation itself was subjected to slavery and futility by human sinfulness. And it now waits to be set free so as to share in the g</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">lorious liberty of all of God’s children.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Paul bases his optimistic outlook on the fact that Christ’s death and resurrection has already accomplished the </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">work of reconciling humanity to the Father </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Colossians 1:19-20). </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Creation is thus made new</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Revelation 21:5).

			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Such considerations help us to get a better understanding of the </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">relationship between human activity and the whole of creation. When we turn our back on the Creator’s plan ...</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> we set up a chain reaction which has inevitable shockwaves on the rest of the created order.

			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In his message for the World Day of Peace (January 2010)  Pope Benedict XVI asked: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Can we remain indifferent before the problems associated with such realities as climate change, desertification, the deterioration and loss of productivity in the vast agricultural areas, the pollution of rivers and aquifers, the loss of biodiversity, the increase of natural catastrophes and the deforestation of equatorial and tropical regions? Can we disregard the growing phenomenon of ‘environmental refugees’, people who are forced by the degradation of their natural habitat to forsake it – and often their possessions as well – in order to face the dangers and uncertainties of forced displacement?</span></p>

			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">St John Paul II highlighted that the most important indication of the moral implications behind the ecological crisis</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18"> is the lack of respect for life evident in many patterns of environmental pollution. </span><span class="CharOverride-18">The interests of big business often take priority over concern for the dignity of workers, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">while economic interests take priority over the good of individuals, even entire populations.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">On another level, delicate ecological balances are easily upset by greedy people who wantonly destroy animal and plant life by recklessly exploiting natural resources. Even when carried out in the name of progress, such wanton exploitation disadvantages everyone. Pope Francis writes:</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">We need to reject a magical conception of the market, which would suggest that problems can be solved simply by an increase in the profits of companies or individuals. … Where profits alone count, there can be no thinking about the rhythms of nature, its phases of decay and regeneration, or the complexity of ecosystems which may be gravely upset by human intervention </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(On Care of Our Common Home, 190).</span></p>

The planet is in truth a fine and delicate balance of life. While God invites us to explore it and utilise it, we must at the same time, respect the integrity of creation and never exploit it. The earth is ultimately our common heritage whose fruits are meant for the benefit of all: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">The goods of creation belong to humanity as a whole</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (St John Paul II, World Day of Peace 1990).</span></p>

			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Pope Francis points to a fundamental connection between human development, holiness and the outpouring love of the Trinity:</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">The human person grows more, matures more and is sanctified more to the extent that he or she enters into relationships, going out from themselves to live in communion with God, with others and with all creatures. In this way, they make their own that trinitarian dynamism which God imprinted in them when they were created. Everything is interconnected, and this invites us to develop a spirituality of that global solidarity which flows from the mystery of the Trinity </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(240). </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In 2001, St John Paul II described humanity’s disregard for the integrity of creation as </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">humiliating the earth; that flower-bed that is our home. </span><span class="CharOverride-18">Prophetically, in this address, St John Paul II called the world’s Catholics to an </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">ecological conversion </span><span class="CharOverride-18">to avoid planetary </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">catastrophe (17</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-28">th</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18"> January 2001)</span><span class="CharOverride-18">.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This global situation requires action on a global scale. In a Christian sense, action emerges from a deep sense of solidarity with other human beings. The environment is God’s gift to everyone, and as Pope Benedict XVI urged, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">in our use of it we have a responsibility towards the poor, towards future generations and towards humanity as a whole. </span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Poverty, national debts, war</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Finding the proper ecological balance also requires that the structural forms of poverty that exist throughout the world are seriously addressed and challenged. In many countries, rural poverty and unjust land distribution have led to subsistence farming and consequent exhaustion of the soil. Once their land is unable to yield any more, many farmers move on to clear new land, and so the process of uncontrolled deforestation is accelerated. Or perhaps, they abandon the land and move into already crowded cities which do not have the infrastructure to receive and support them.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Some countries are so heavily in debt to world banks. They are destroying their natural heritage in order to keep up with paying the interest on their loans. Global financial crises have demonstrated how personal and corporate greed drive global financial conditions. This has consequences not only for countries and nations, but also for families and individuals. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The poor have to be helped to find a way out of their poverty. This is going to require courageous reform of existing world structures as well as new ways of relating among nations.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Another dangerous menace to citizens of planet earth is both the threat and the reality of war. Modern science has the capacity to change the environment for hostile purposes in a way that in the long term could have calamitous consequences. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Despite international agreements prohibiting chemical, bacteriological and biological warfare, laboratories continue to develop weapons capable of altering the balance of nature in an unforeseeable way. The human society needs to be constantly vigilant in its concern for peace. Treaties to reduce nuclear warheads are only small steps to the ultimate goal of ridding the world of destructive weaponry. Any war on a global scale today would lead to incalculable ecological and human damage. We know that even local or regional conflicts cause damage to the land, as well as poisoning the water and leaving the soil damaged and unworkable because of landmines, unexploded munitions, and toxic waste. This is of course in addition to the untold human cost of war. </span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">A challenge to all</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">We will never find a solution to the ecological crisis unless we take a good hard look at our own lifestyle. Despite some positive signs of a change of heart, our western society is still given to instant gratification and consumerism, while remaining for the most part indifferent to the damage which these cause. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Quoting St John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI challenged our complacency with a call to consider our lifestyle: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Environmental degradation challenges us to examine our lifestyle and the prevailing models of consumption and production ... We can no longer do without a real change of outlook which will result in new lifestyles, ‘in which the quest for truth, beauty, goodness and communion with others for the sake of common growth are the factors which determine consumer choices, savings and investments’. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">There is, therefore, an urgent need for world-wide education in ecological responsibility – responsibility for myself, for other people, and for planet earth. Churches, religious bodies, governmental, non-governmental bodies, in fact, all members of society, have a part to play in such education. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The first educator will always be the family. It is here that we teach the child to respect her or his neighbour and to love nature. It is the next generation which is becoming the great teacher of the previous generation. Many parents and grandparents are being taught by the youngest to respect the environment and change behaviours of consumption. St John Paul II saw the growing concern for the health of the environment as one of the signs of hope that the Holy Spirit provides for our times.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Respect for creation creates and nurtures a deep sense of harmonious relationship. Our very contact with the beauty of nature has a deep restorative (therapeutic) power. </span><span class="CharOverride-18">Contemplating its magnificence imparts peace and serenity.

They are all inter-related. Pope Benedict XVI makes the point that </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">the decisive issue is the overall moral tenor of society. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">A central principle of Catholic social justice teaching is that of working for ‘the common good’. This was defined at the Second Vatican Council as </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">the sum of those conditions of social life which allow social groups and their individual members relatively thorough and ready access to their own fulfilment </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, 26). </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">We, who believe in a creator God, should possess a strong sense of working for the dignity of life and the care of the planet for the common good – for this generation and generations to come, especially for the poor and the most vulnerable. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">As Christians, we need to acknowledge that our responsibility to nature and its Creator is an essential part of our faith. For Pope Francis this means an ever-deepening understanding of an ‘integral ecology’. Pope Francis is referring to an understanding that is much broader than simply protecting plants and animals. Rather he is referring to the interdependence of an environmental, economic and social ecology. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The word ‘ecology’ has its origins in two Greek words: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">oikos</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (house, dwelling place, habitation) and </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">logia</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (study of). Pope Francis is leading us to see that the care of our common dwelling place – our home, Mother Earth – demands </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">an integrated approach to combating poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same time protecting nature </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(139).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">It also entails a loving awareness that we are not disconnected from the rest of creatures, but joined in a splendid universal communion. As believers, we do not look at the world from without but from within, conscious of the bonds with which the Father has linked us to all beings. By developing our individual, God-given capacities, an ecological conversion can inspire us to greater creativity and enthusiasm in resolving the world’s problems … </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(220).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">For this integral ecology to develop Pope Francis believes two values (that have often not been esteemed in modern society) are required: sobriety and humility. </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Once we lose our humility, and become enthralled with the possibility of limitless mastery over everything, we inevitably end up harming society and the environment. It is not easy to promote this kind of healthy humility or happy sobriety when we consider ourselves autonomous, when we exclude God from our lives or replace him with our own ego, and think that our subjective feelings can define what is right and what is wrong</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (224).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Call to action</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Latin title of Pope Francis’ encyclical, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">On Care of Our Common Home</span><span class="CharOverride-18">, is the opening line from the beautiful hymn of St Francis: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Laudato Si’, mi’ Signore – Praise be to you, my Lord</span><span class="CharOverride-18">. Pope Francis (and St Francis) is reminding us that the earth is our common home. It is through this deep sense of kinship, familial relationships and connectedness that St Francis can speak of:</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Mother Earth, <br />&#9;who sustains us and governs us,<br />&#9;and produces various fruits <br />&#9;with coloured flowers and herbs.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In a sense, this is a very </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">catholic</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> understanding of reality. For, we are </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">linked by unseen bonds and together form a kind of universal family, a sublime communion which fills us with a sacred, affectionate and humble respect </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(89). </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The earth is not inexhaustible or exists merely for our consumption. Creation is the place of God’s self-revelation, a delicate balance of a rich variety of life. As St Thomas Aquinas pondered, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">because one creature was not enough, God produced many and diverse things so that what was wanting in one expression of the divine goodness might be supplied by another </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Summa Theologiae 1a.47.1). </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This is a vital insight to avoid the danger of the spiritual and theological perspective of pantheism – of turning the earth or nature into God. Rather it sheds light on a perspective or paradigm known as </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">panentheism</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> – that, while remaining distinct, the divine penetrates every part of the universe and to the very core of all creation. In the words of St Simeon, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">for those who ponder in the Spirit, God is present everywhere … in all and beyond all </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Practical and Theological Discourses). </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Just as the Works of Mercy call us to act compassionately towards our neighbour Pope Francis is asking us to act with mercy towards </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">the earth herself, burdened and laid waste … We have forgotten that we ourselves are dust of the earth (cf. Genesis 2:7); our very bodies are made up of her elements, we breathe her air and we receive life and refreshment from her waters </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(2). </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Today a Christian spirituality and lifestyle is often counter to the prevailing culture. The ancient tradition of </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">less is more, </span><span class="CharOverride-18">as exemplified by the Desert Fathers (and Mothers) and monastic orders in the middle ages, is a prophetic stance against rampant consumerism. The Australian bishops have pointed out that </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">we must examine our lives and acknowledge the ways in which we have harmed God’s creation through our actions and our failure to act</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (A New Earth: The Environmental Challenge, ACBC, 2002). But it is not just at the personal level that we are being challenged to make changes. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Church’s teaching on social justice requires that every effort be made by governments at international, national and community level to protect the environment to ensure the common good for all the earth’s people. Pope Francis insists that decisions not be made just for short-term growth but that </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">the notion of the common good also extends to future generations </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(159-162). </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">He also reminds us that it is easy to be discouraged in the face of news of another environmental disaster, yet </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">… all is not lost. Human beings, while capable of the worst, are also capable of rising above themselves, choosing again what is good, and making a new start … We are able to take an honest look at ourselves, to acknowledge our deep dissatisfaction, and to embark on new paths … </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(205).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">We are now at a point in human history where we need to reconsider every aspect of our communal existence. Things we have taken for granted previously can be taken for granted no longer. We can no longer pollute the atmosphere without consequence. We would not pollute a river and expect to drink clean water.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">For Christians there is a sacred and spiritual dimension to our choices. We contemplate the entire cosmos in light of the creative work of the Father and the Incarnation of the Son and the renewing energy of the Holy Spirit.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Spirit, the Lord the Giver of life, is constantly at play in the world, renewing the work of creation (Proverbs 8:30-31). Creation is the beginning and foundation of God’s self-revelation. We live in the hope and anticipation of that day when all of creation will be gathered together in Christ and transformed into </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">a new heaven and a new earth</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Revelation 21:1-5). God will not desert, abandon or destroy creation. God will transform creation and make </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">all things new </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(Revelation 21:5).</span></p>

			<p class="body ParaOverride-13"><span class="text-after-drop-cap CharOverride-18">eath is an experience<br /></span><span class="CharOverride-18"> that comes to all of us in time,</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> but it is the one we know the least about. Not only is it a  mystery in the sense that it is beyond our complete understanding, but it is also something outside our experience. Until we have died we cannot speak with authority about death, and once we have died there is no return.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">However something must be said about it, because the whole direction of our lives is towards what comes after death. Christian teaching includes the simple but profound truth that Christ died so that we might live.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">For those with no belief in an after-life, death is a frightening moment that should be postponed as long as possible. Even believers cling naturally to life as long as possible because of fear of the unknown and the unwillingness to leave loved ones, but their faith tells them that physical death is not the be-all and end-all of human existence, but marks a transition from life on earth to a richer, fuller life in the company of God for all eternity.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ changed the meaning of death. The Christian who is united to Christ through faith and baptism is joined to him also in his death and resurrection. This union with Christ gives to death a new meaning, and his resurrection is the pledge and guarantee of ours.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">What Jesus shows us</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus himself experienced fear and sorrow at the prospect of his own death, or at least at the prospect of the suffering which awaited him. In the Garden of Gethsemane, he prayed to his Father to release him from this obligation. Mindful of this we need not feel guilty about our own natural fear of death, for there need be nothing un-Christian about it. Nor is it un-Christian to grieve for loved ones who have died. Although we accept in faith that they are now enjoying eternal life with Christ, grief, loneliness and sadness are natural human emotions. Grieving in fact is a healthy and necessary part of our human condition. In time, grief becomes a loving memory. The faith that leads to our own hope of resurrection will also be our source of strength in time of grief.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">On the other hand, the shadow of the cross fell over Jesus’ life from the beginning, and he fully and freely accepted it. After he overcame his human fear on the night before his death, his state of mind and will returned to that full acceptance: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">yet not what I want but what you want</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Matthew 26:39). Jesus’ death was his final voluntary act of total self-giving – to the Father and for humanity.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In his farewell words to his disciples, Jesus told them he was going to prepare a place for them (John 14:1-3). Throughout his life, he told parables or stories which included references to a life beyond death. The parable of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31) is a story which teaches this truth clearly.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Scriptures teach us also that the resurrection of Jesus is our hope, his assurance to us that we will follow him. Paul says that by rising from death, Jesus has become the first-born of many brothers and sisters, and first-fruits of the harvest to come. Paul also speaks of the unending duration of this life beyond the grave – </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (2 Corinthians 5:1). The bishops of the Second Vatican Council state: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">It is in regard to death that the human condition is most shrouded in doubt ... But a deep instinct leads them rightly to shrink from and to reject the utter ruin and total loss of their personality. Because they bear in themselves the seed of eternity, which cannot be reduced to mere matter, they rebel against death ... For God has called them, and still calls them to cleave with all their being to Him in sharing forever a life that is divine and free from all decay – Christ won the victory when he rose to life, for by his death he freed us from death </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">The Church in the Modern World </span><span class="CharOverride-18">no 18)</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Vatican II document continues: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">It is therefore through Christ, and in Christ, that light is thrown on the riddle of suffering and death, which, apart from his gospel, overwhelms us. Christ has risen again, destroying death by his death, and has given life abundantly to us </span><span class="CharOverride-18">(no 22).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">As followers of Christ, our model in all things, we place our life as a whole in God’s hands. Jesus’ prayer as he died on the cross, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Father, into your hands I commend my spirit</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Luke 23:46) was really the prayer of his whole life. So it must be with us, and not just something tacked on at the end.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">If our life is lived in this spirit of acceptance of God’s will, we can be sure that at the moment of death a loving and merciful Father will give us the courage and strength to overcome our natural fears.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">What manuals of theology call ‘the last things’ comprise death, judgement, heaven, hell and purgatory. At first sight, most of these might seem fearful, painful prospects. But in fact, the death and resurrection of Jesus has transformed the face of death and of all those fearful consequences of death, into objects of faith and hope.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">Judgement</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">At the moment of death, we will stand before God as we truly are. We will experience the presence of God, all the love and goodness of God, and we will be confronted with our own worthiness or unworthiness to enter this presence. In that confrontation, God need not judge us, since we judge ourselves.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The word judgement of itself does not imply condemnation. In many Old Testament passages which speak of God bringing judgement for the people, the meaning is that God will uphold and vindicate the rights of the innocent. It is only when people deliberately refuse to live by the covenant that God’s judgement turns against them.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In the New Testament there is a continual tension between the ‘already’ and the ‘not yet’. God’s kingdom has come: God’s kingdom will come. We are now saved: we are not yet saved. We already have eternal life: we will gain eternal life. Christ has come: Christ will come again.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is the same with judgement. Judgement is not just a future event – at the moment of death or on the last day. Judgement is something that is already now taking place in the lives of each one of us: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">And this is the judgement, that the light has come into the world, and people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (John 3:19).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus places judgement in the midst of daily life when he says that a person’ eternity will depend on how in this life he or she treats the hungry and thirsty, the strangers, the naked, the sick, the prisoners (Matthew 25:31-40). ‘Judgement’ is simply a way of saying that God will uncover all that already is. We participate in this ‘judgement’ even now by the small and large choices we make in coming to be who we are. ‘Judgement’ is God revealing who we are. The social and human sciences have taught us that human beings are complex realities, and only God knows the true and false motives of the human heart. For this reason, we need to avoid a ‘juridical’ sense of the term. The same God who has been the spoken and unspoken reality of our lives – the known and unknown mover and shaper – is the same God who greets us in justice, love and mercy. ‘Judgement’ is the moment of revelation of our true selves before our Creator. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">We should not ignore the possibility of condemnation, but in faith and hope we know that God is primarily a Saviour – and that the judgement will be in favour of those who love God. Jesus has said: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">anyone who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life, and does not come under judgement, but has passed from death to life</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (John 5:24).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">General judgement</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">In the Gospels, there are numerous references to a ‘general judgement’, that is, the judgement that God will render on all men and women at the end of time, when Christ will come again in glory. Some of the biblical descriptions of this ‘day of the Lord’ are clothed in fearful language, portraying it as a day of wrath, a dreadful day. In the first place, it needs to be recognised that this occasion will indeed be a dreadful experience for those who have deliberately chosen to live without God. Secondly, these biblical accounts of the judgement are framed in a particular form of writing current at the time, called ‘apocalyptic’, and should not be taken as a literal description of the event.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus clearly taught a final, general judgement, but gave clear warnings against trying to calculate its date, which is known only to God (Mark 13:32). The fact is that at all times, the human race lives under the reality of the judgement. We are meant to live each day of our lives, not in fear, but in expectation that God’s judgement is imminent.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Christians do not look forward to a final catastrophe, the terrible day of the Lord described in parts of Scripture. The Church’s whole ministry of reconciliation wards off that fearful prospect. For us, the final judgement should be seen rather as the perfect and complete establishment of the heavenly community, the Kingdom of God in its final and perfect phase, the beginning of an eternal era of peace and happiness.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The general or last judgement will bring about no reversal of the judgement which we have passed upon ourselves at the moment of death. As we have said, judgement is in the process of being made now, on the basis of whether our decision is for Christ or against him.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Major-Sub-Heading">The resurrection <br />of the body</p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">We have seen also the teaching of Scripture that Jesus’ resurrection is the pledge and the guarantee of the future resurrection of all who are joined to him by baptism and in faith and love. Paul uses some vivid and powerful imagery in an attempt to describe this glorious transformation that awaits us, which will result in direct communion with God.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">He says we will all be changed, from corruptible to incorruptible, mortal to immortal, natural to spiritual, ignoble to glorious (1 Corinthians 15:35-37, 42-44, 52-53). At the same time, he confesses that it is useless to speculate on what kind of ‘body’ those who are raised will have.</span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-52"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Third Eucharistic Prayer has an addition in Masses for the Dead (funeral Masses) which, quite poetically, captures the Christian hope of resurrection: </span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-55"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Grant that he (she) who was united with your Son in a death like his, </span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-55"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">may also be one with him in his Resurrection, </span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-55"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">when from the earth he will raise up in the flesh those who have died, </span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-55"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">and transform our lowly body </span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-55"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">after the pattern of his own glorious body. </span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-55"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">To our departed brothers and sisters, too, </span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-55"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">and to all who were pleasing to you </span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-55"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">at their passing from this life, </span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-55"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">give kind admittance to your kingdom. </span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-55"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">There we hope to enjoy for ever the fullness of your glory, </span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-55"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">when you will wipe away every tear from our eyes. </span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-55"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">For seeing you, our God, as you are, </span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-55"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">we shall be like you for all the ages </span></p>
			<p class="body ParaOverride-57"><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">and praise you without end.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">This prayer expresses the hope of ‘deification’ – a theological term which is emphasised in the Eastern Christian traditions. The prayer declares that in ‘seeing God’ as God truly is, we shall become like God. God spares nothing in sharing the life of the Trinity with us. Our ultimate participation in the life of God is a transformation into the ‘likeness’ of God ‘for all ages’. </span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Heaven</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is also pointless to try to give a pictorial description of what heaven will be like. From God’s word, we can conclude that even though the final ‘bodily’ resurrection of believers will take place only at the end of time, our enjoyment of the presence of God in heaven will begin when we experience God’s favourable judgement at the moment of death.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">What we can say of heaven is that it will be a perfect sharing in God’s loving presence for all eternity. The love we feel for another person here on earth is only a shadow of the love we will experience when we come into the unveiled presence of God. Paul knew that the happiness of heaven could not be expressed in words. Speaking of the glory of heaven he wrote: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the human heart conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (1 Corinthians 2:9) and John wrote: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Beloved, we are God’s children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this: when he</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">is revealed, we will be like him, for we will see him as he is</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (1 John 3:2).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">In heaven, the pains and struggles of this life will cease. In this life, sorrow and grief are inevitable, as for example when we have to part with those we love. Pain, frustration, discouragement, and temptation are our familiar companions on our journey through this life. In heaven, God’s love will so overwhelm us, that all sorrow, pain and temptation will cease to exist.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is a shame that ‘heaven’ has been trivialised in the popular imagination. Heaven is often described as an extension of the pleasurable activities of this life. Images of clouds and harps and heavenly singing can make heaven sound boring. This is not heaven in a full and rich Christian understanding. In the words of Australian theologian, Anthony Kelly, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">heaven is the point when all the gifts of God in life (and death) reach their culmination</span><span class="CharOverride-18">. Heaven is not so much a reward but a gift, for we no longer contemplate God from the outside but we experience God through </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">an immersion in the boundless ocean of Trinitarian life.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> As St Augustine once wrote, </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">After this life, God is where we will be. </span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Hell</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Hell is a state of eternal rejection of God. At the moment of death, we will experience a deep yearning to be with God. At that same moment, we are brought face to face with the truth of our lives and see ourselves as having either accepted or rejected God by the way we have lived. As a result of the virtues that we have cultivated and the fundamental choices that we have made, our eternal destiny – heaven or hell – is determined. It is not so much that God sends a person to hell – no, a person chooses hell by their own free will. We ultimately choose to live a life orientated towards God and others or a life orientated towards ourselves.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The person whose earthly life has been an existence without love, selfishly turned in upon himself or herself, heedless of God or the things of the Spirit, will be simply incapable of choosing God at the moment of truth. He or she will inevitably continue that state of rejection of God, unable to do otherwise. They are frozen in their own life choice, a life choice shaped by many decisions freely made along the way.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Not even God can force love, which must be freely given. Throughout each person’s life, there are countless offers of mercy and forgiveness. Death marks the last of these moments. For one who has died in spirit long before, it is the moment when the fundamental decision is signed and sealed. Hell is living with that decision forever. It is no reflection on the love and mercy of God. God has done everything possible to save, except to take away human freedom.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Hell consists in a state of deep, burning loneliness or alienation from God. In the Scriptures it is often described in terms of an eternal fire, e.g. Matthew 25:41. There can of course be no material fire in a spiritual state of existence. This biblical imagery is chosen to emphasise the horror of the pain of hell, which really consists in the irrevocable loss of God, for whom each person is created.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Bible does not tell us whether any person has in fact been condemned, or condemned himself to hell. It is not said explicitly, even of Judas, that he is in that state, though Jesus did remark in ominous words: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">It would have been better for that one not to have been born</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Matthew 26:24). It might be argued that no one in his right mind would make the kind of fundamental decision against God, which we have described. Certainly, we may hope that those condemned for eternity represent a proportionately small group of humanity. But how many and who in particular are in hell is not for us to judge – this is something known only to God.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Jesus warned us against judging others (Matthew 7:1-2). We have no way of entering into another person’s conscience or of understanding why people act the way they do. We can judge that certain actions – like murder – are evil in themselves, but whether the person who performs that action is guilty of sin is beyond our power to judge. We cannot know the extent of a person’s full responsibility or state of mind when he or she so acts.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Turning again to theologian Anthony Kelly, he strikingly (and perhaps shockingly) declares that </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Christians must hope that hell exists.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> Why? This is not because we look forward to the damnation of any human being, but rather we look to the final state in which </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">evil will be revealed for what it is and brought to nothing.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> Hell </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">looks to the point at which there will be no more room for hatreds and violence ... It forbids any representation of God’s love as tolerance of evil or a compromise with it. Hell is where evil is contained, rendered impotent, and made to serve the higher purposes of a good creation ... Evil will be disclosed as a parasite living off the original good of creation.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> We know from our own lives and human history that evil exists. Our understanding of the term ‘hell’ encompasses both our recognition of the reality of evil and our hope that evil will be ultimately overcome by God.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The question of Purgatory</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">This consideration of the last things leaves us with the question of Purgatory. It is a term not found in the Scriptures and remains one of the points of disagreement between Catholics and Protestants. It is important therefore to understand exactly what the Church teaches on the subject.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The official teaching of the Church is that there is a Purgatory and that the souls detained in this state are helped by our prayers, especially by the offering of the Eucharist on their behalf. The Church does not have anything to say about its duration. Indeed duration in purgatory is a real problem, because in the hereafter, time no longer exists. Certainly we must not imagine Purgatory to be a kind of concentration camp or a temporary hell. It is blasphemous to think of God as demanding the last pound of flesh.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The word comes from a Latin term meaning purifying or cleansing. It seems preferable to think of purgatory not in terms of time or place or punishment, but in terms of a purifying process. It is the painful aspect of the passage from this life into God’s loving presence. At the moment of death, we are confronted with God and all the infinite love and holiness of God. In the light of this, many of us – if not all of us – will painfully and shamefully become aware of our weakness and sinfulness. In the light of God’s utter goodness, we can only acknowledge that which is darkness and sin within us. It is easy to imagine how at this passage from death to life, we will have to pass through the ‘purifying fire’ of God’s love.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The pain of purgatory has nothing in common with the pain of hell. It is rather the pain of wanting to be made totally worthy of union with God. In the light of God’s love we will know that we have not cut ourselves off completely, but we will also be brought face-to-face with the selfishness and the turning away from God in minor ways, which have marked our journey through this life.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Purgatory then will be the experience of people who know they are saved and invited into God’s presence for all eternity, but know also that for this step to be taken, they need to be purified by the fire of God’s love.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is possible that some people are completely purified in this life. Our present existence is a form of purgatory, as we die daily to whatever is selfish, untrue, un-Christlike, and are daily being raised up by Christ to share more deeply in his life. For those who are fully open to Christ’s purifying action in this life, purgatory is already negotiated.</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Communion of Saints</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">One of the most beautiful and consoling doctrines of the Catholic Church is what we call the ‘Communion of Saints’. This is the Church’s teaching to the effect that there is an unbreakable bond between the Church on earth, the saints in heaven and those experiencing purgatory. Each year in the Church’s liturgical calendar, two successive days of celebration bring this truth home to us. On November 1st, we honour all the saints in heaven, not only canonised saints – those who have been officially declared by the Church to be with God because of their lives of evident holiness – but all who have gone before us to share God’s eternal happiness. They include those relatives and friends whom we have known and loved in this life.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The Church celebrates All Souls’ Day on November 2</span><span class="CharOverride-28">nd</span><span class="CharOverride-18">. On this day we pray for our relatives, friends and others who have passed from this life to eternity. The Church teaches that the dead may profit from our prayers as they pass through purgatory. This practice of praying for the dead is mentioned in the pre-Christian book of Maccabees (2 Maccabees 12:43-46).</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">If we understand purgatory not in terms of a time of detention, but in terms of a passage from the selfishness of this life to the full love of heaven, we might ask how our prayers benefit the dead. We do not know precisely how our prayers help those who experience purgatory. But we pray with faith, believing that somehow in God’s goodness and in the mystery of eternity, our prayers have made their passage to God less painful. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">It is helpful to understand that all prayer is ultimately a gift inspired by the Spirit and that all our prayers share in the great prayer and intercession of Christ. The living and dead are bound by a communion of love – not by time and space. We do not pray for those who have died in order to persuade God to be more merciful. Rather, God inspires us to pray so that we might share in the salvation of each other. </span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Many Christians have already begun the process of preparing for death in their own lives, since they see their eternal destiny always before them. Paul shares with us the insight of a man who has already accepted the fact of his death, and who even looks forward to that moment with some longing</span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">: For to me, living is Christ and dying is gain. If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labour for me; and I do not know which I prefer. I am hard pressed between the two: my desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better; but to remain in the flesh is more necessary for you.</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> (Philippians 1:21-24).</span></p>
			<p class="_-Minor-Sub-Heading"><span class="CharOverride-18">Come, Lord Jesus</span></p>
			<p class="body-1-first-par"><span class="CharOverride-18">Death held no fear for Paul. He had reached the point of acceptance and now awaited the fulfilment of his desire for God’s uninterrupted presence.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Although we have been concentrating on the destiny of the individual Christian, the ultimate object of Christian faith and hope is the final coming of the kingdom of God. In the early years of the Church, the followers of Jesus lived in lively expectation of the second coming of Christ. That vivid expectation has now faded. It had already receded by the end of the New Testament period. But the perfection of the kingdom remains the ultimate goal of Christian and human history.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">Although the Church provides a home for believers, it is only a temporary haven, for our earthly condition is one of people on a pilgrimage, moving towards our true homeland.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">The bishops of the Second Vatican Council give us the following hopeful advice, in which they describe the task and goal of Christian living and striving: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">When we have spread on earth the fruits of our nature and our enterprise – human dignity, communion, and freedom – according to the command of the Lord and in his Spirit, we will find them once again ... illuminated and transfigured when Christ presents to his Father an eternal and universal kingdom of truth and life, a kingdom of holiness and grace, a kingdom of justice, love and peace. Here on earth the kingdom is mysteriously present; when the Lord comes it will enter into its perfection.</span></p>
			<p class="body"><span class="CharOverride-18">We can therefore make our final prayer that of the early Jewish Christians, the prayer with which Paul concludes his first letter to the Corinthians and which closes the book of Revelation: </span><span class="Body-type-It-demi CharOverride-18">Come, Lord Jesus!</span></p>
