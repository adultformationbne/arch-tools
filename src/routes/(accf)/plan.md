# ACCF Platform Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

**ACCF (Archdiocesan Center for Catholic Formation)** is a set of 4 8 week module courses and this is a platform that will integrate with the existing arch-tools system as a unified codebase with separate domain-based user experiences.

## ðŸŽ‰ CURRENT STATUS: MVP COMPLETE âœ…

The ACCF platform is **fully functional and production-ready**. All core MVP features have been implemented and tested:

### ðŸš€ **Ready for Feb 2025 Launch**
- **60+ student capacity** with real-time progress tracking
- **Complete admin control** over cohorts, enrollment, and progression
- **Rich student experience** with progressive learning and reflections
- **Professional ACCF branding** throughout the platform
- **Secure authentication** with role-based access control

### ðŸ“Š **Key Metrics Achieved**
- **100% MVP completion** across all 4 major task areas
- **8-week progressive course structure** with materials and reflections
- **Multi-role access** (students, admins, hub coordinators)
- **Real-time data** integration with Supabase backend
- **Production-grade security** with comprehensive RLS policies

### ðŸ›  **Implemented Features Summary**

#### **Task 1: Admin Cohort Management** âœ…
- Complete cohort CRUD with enrollment tracking
- Student enrollment system with hub/admin assignment
- Materials management (videos, documents, native content)
- Reflection questions management per week

#### **Task 2: Student Reflection System** âœ…
- Rich text editor with auto-save functionality
- Draft/submit workflow with status tracking
- Public/private sharing with cohort community
- Admin feedback integration

#### **Task 3: Authentication & Domain Routing** âœ…
- Domain-based login flows (/login for students, /auth for admins)
- Role-based access control and automatic redirects
- ACCF-branded student interface with proper security
- Setup tools for easy admin permission assignment

#### **Task 4: Student Progression Controls** âœ…
- Individual and bulk student advancement
- Progressive revelation (week-based content access)
- Visual progress tracking for admins and students
- Database-driven current_week enforcement

### Architecture Decision
- **Single codebase** with domain-based routing (arch-tools.vercel.app vs accf-platform.com)
- **Shared Supabase database** with logical separation via RLS and table structure
- **Unified authentication system** with role-based access

## Domain Structure

### Internal Domain (arch-tools.vercel.app)
- Staff login for CMS/admin tools
- Existing functionality (DGR, content editor, scripture reader)
- ACCF admin interface

### Student Domain (accf-platform.com)
- Student login for course platform
- Hub coordinator access
- Course content and reflections

## Course Structure

### Program Architecture
- **4 Independent Modules** (can be taken in any order)
- **8 Weekly Sessions per Module**
- **2 Cohorts per Year**: February start and August start
- **2 Year Total Timeline** to complete all modules

### Participation Types
1. **Hub-based**: Groups meet in homes/parish halls, watch livestream, discuss locally
2. **Flagship**: In-person attendance at main filming location

### User Roles
1. **Students**: Complete reflections, attend sessions
2. **Hub Coordinators**: Manage local groups, track attendance
3. **Admin Staff**: Mark reflections, manage progression, track attendance

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

#### Users & Authentication
```sql
users (
  id uuid primary key,
  email text unique,
  name text,
  role text, -- 'student', 'hub_coordinator', 'admin', 'staff'
  completed_cohorts jsonb, -- Array of cohort IDs for tracking module completion
  created_at timestamp,
  updated_at timestamp
)
```

#### Hub Management
```sql
hubs (
  id uuid primary key,
  name text,
  coordinator_id uuid references users(id),
  location text,
  created_at timestamp,
  updated_at timestamp
)
```

#### Course Structure
```sql
modules (
  id uuid primary key,
  name text, -- 'Module 1', 'Module 2', etc.
  description text,
  order_number integer
)

cohorts (
  id uuid primary key,
  module_id uuid references modules(id),
  name text, -- 'Feb 2025 Module 1'
  start_date date,
  end_date date,
  status text, -- 'planned', 'active', 'completed'
  created_at timestamp,
  updated_at timestamp
)
```

#### Enrollment & Progression
```sql
enrollments (
  id uuid primary key,
  user_id uuid references users(id),
  cohort_id uuid references cohorts(id),
  hub_id uuid references hubs(id), -- nullable for flagship attendees
  current_week integer default 1,
  status text, -- 'active', 'held', 'completed', 'withdrawn'
  assigned_admin_id uuid references users(id), -- for reflection marking
  enrolled_at timestamp,
  updated_at timestamp
)
```

#### Session Content Management
```sql
materials (
  id uuid primary key,
  cohort_id uuid references cohorts(id),
  week_number integer,
  type text, -- 'video', 'document', 'link', 'native', 'image'
  title text,
  content text, -- YouTube URL, file path, markdown, HTML, etc.
  display_order integer,
  created_at timestamp,
  updated_at timestamp
)

reflection_questions (
  id uuid primary key,
  cohort_id uuid references cohorts(id),
  week_number integer,
  question_text text,
  created_at timestamp,
  updated_at timestamp
)
```

#### Student Interactions
```sql
reflection_responses (
  id uuid primary key,
  user_id uuid references users(id),
  reflection_question_id uuid references reflection_questions(id),
  content text,
  is_public boolean default false, -- Student privacy choice
  status text, -- 'draft', 'submitted', 'marked'
  feedback text,
  pass_fail boolean, -- nullable until marked
  marked_by uuid references users(id),
  assigned_to uuid references users(id), -- admin assigned for marking
  submitted_at timestamp,
  marked_at timestamp,
  created_at timestamp,
  updated_at timestamp
)

attendance (
  id uuid primary key,
  user_id uuid references users(id),
  cohort_id uuid references cohorts(id),
  week_number integer,
  present boolean,
  marked_by uuid references users(id), -- hub coordinator or admin
  attendance_type text, -- 'hub', 'flagship'
  notes text,
  created_at timestamp,
  updated_at timestamp
)
```

## Key Business Rules

### Progressive Revelation System
- Students only see current and past week materials
- Default behavior: Auto-advance after each session
- Admin override: Can "hold" students at current week
- Email notifications triggered on advancement

### Attendance & Progression Rules
- System flags students with 3+ missed sessions
- Admin discretion for advancement decisions
- One attendance record per student per session
- Admin attendance records take precedence over hub coordinator records

### Reflection Management
- Final deadline: 2 weeks after module completion
- Students can complete all reflections at once if desired
- 60% completion rate expected (no enforcement needed)
- Qualitative feedback with pass/fail marking

### Admin Assignment System
- Reflections auto-assigned to admins by dividing students evenly
- Each admin gets all reflections for their assigned students
- Assignments can be manually adjusted
- All admins can view all reflections

## Technical Implementation

### Route Structure
```
src/routes/
â”œâ”€â”€ (internal)/                 # arch-tools.vercel.app
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ login/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ accf-admin/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cohorts/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ marking/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ reports/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [existing routes]/
â”œâ”€â”€ (student)/                  # accf-platform.com
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ login/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ week-[id]/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ reflections/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ hub/
â””â”€â”€ +layout.svelte             # Domain detection logic
```

### Domain Detection Logic
```javascript
// Root layout domain routing
const isStudentDomain = url.hostname === 'accf-platform.com';
const isInternalDomain = url.hostname.includes('arch-tools');

// Route appropriately based on domain and user role
```

### Email System (Resend Integration)
- **Weekly Advancement**: "Week X materials now available"
- **Reflection Deadlines**: Reminder notifications
- **Admin Notifications**: New reflections to mark
- **Batch Processing**: Coordinated with bulk advancement workflow

### File Storage
- **Documents/PDFs**: Vercel Blob Storage
- **Videos**: YouTube embed links only
- **Images**: Vercel Blob Storage
- **Native Documents**: Markdown/HTML stored in database
