Jesus, sent by God the Father to save us, offers the world hope through his life, death and resurrection. Jesus remains a living presence among us through the Holy Spirit and empowers us for Christian discipleship.",
        "Through these pages you will uncover how the early Christian community grew and responded to the problems and issues of the world. Today the Catholic Church provides a community of faith for its members to worship God and equips them for Christian mission in the world."

It is important to remember however that this is only one resource for this phase of your faith journey. This resource is not the ‘program to become a Catholic’! There is much wisdom in an old adage: ‘faith is caught, not taught’. Central to your journey during this period is your active participation in the local worshipping community and reflection on the Sunday scriptures.",
            "The Catechumenate is sometimes seen as an ‘apprenticeship’ into the Christian life during which you will: learn to turn more readily to God in prayer; to bear witness to the faith ... to keep [your] hopes set on Christ … and to practise love of neighbour (RCIA no 75 adapted). One objective of this period is to provide you with an appropriate acquaintance … with the precepts and teachings of the Catholic Church (RCIA no 75). At Home with God’s People is one means, or tool, to do that. While the topics in the book are presented in a logical order, please do not feel restricted by this sequence.

In Australia the Rites have been published by St Paul’s Publications and are available in hardback and a study edition. Paragraphs 75-80 cover the Period of the Catechumenate (the period when At Home with God’s People may be a useful resource). Paragraph 78 is very pertinent to your role: The instruction that the catechumens receive during this period should be of a kind that while presenting Catholic teaching in its entirety also enlightens faith, directs the heart toward God, fosters participation in the liturgy, inspires apostolic activity, and nurtures a life completely in accord with the spirit of Christ.",
            "At Home with God’s People provides participants with suggested questions for reflection and discussion. While these may be helpful in the early stages of the group to generate sharing, they are no substitute for the catechumens’ own questions, enquiries and concerns.",
            "One of your key roles in the group is to be a facilitator – one who ‘makes easy’ the work of the group. As a facilitator you will always be adapting the content and process to suit the needs and requirements of the participants. There is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach.",
            "The primary purpose of the Period of the Catechumenate is formation in the Christian life, not information about Christianity. Use whatever resources are appropriate and available. Check out if your parish or diocese has audio-visual resources you can borrow. Inform the catechumens about any adult faith education presentations in the parish or diocese that may be helpful for their on-going faith formation. Encourage participants to experience various aspects of the mission and social action of the parish, e.g. Care and Concern group, St Vincent de Paul Society, Social Justice group."

It is tempting to think of the role of the RCIA team as the ‘Controller’ – efficiently directing traffic, making sure timetables are printed, ensuring trains run on time and that platforms are tidy. However this is to deny the truth that we are in fact a pilgrim church and we take the ‘conversion journey’ together. Perhaps a better analogy is that of the ‘Conductor’. He or she makes the same trip as the passengers and shares with them the same steep climbs, deep gorges, long tunnels and glorious vistas. \nWith open hands and hearts the team – along with catechists, sponsors and the whole parish community – approach this Period of the Catechumenate not with a ‘subject’ to be transmitted, but with a deep humility and openness to the encounter of mutual conversion.",
            "As ‘Conductor’ we allow ourselves to be a channel for God’s grace, transforming love, peace and reconciliation. Paragraph 1 of the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults outlines a vision that, after hearing the mystery of Christ proclaimed, Catechumens seek the living God and enter the way of faith and conversion as the Holy Spirit opens their heart.",
            "As members of the team it is essential that you are clear about vision, purpose, intention and process. The Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults is your ‘guidebook’. For example when you are clear about the purpose of each period of the Catechumenate it will be obvious that a catechesis resource such as At Home with God’s People will not be appropriate for Lent or Mystagogia.",
            "Books such as The RCIA Team Book (Evangelisation Brisbane) can be beneficial resources to provide practical information about specific roles, pastoral principles, planning outlines and practical strategies for each period of the Catechumenate.",
            "The Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults is intended for those who are unbaptised. Part II of the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults provides pastoral guidelines for those people already baptised who express interest in becoming Catholic. Paragraph 391 directs that: The baptised Christian is to receive both doctrinal and spiritual preparation, adapted to individual pastoral requirements, for reception into the full communion of the Catholic Church.",
            "The key phrase here is ‘adapted to individual pastoral requirements’. For example a candidate who has been a regular church-goer may already be very familiar with the Creed and the Bible. In a situation such as this the team, with the catechist, and in dialogue with the candidate, would determine a process of formation that respects the candidate’s journey of faith and current needs. In this way, The rite is arranged so that no greater burden than necessary (see Acts 15:28) is required for the establishment of communion and unity (387)."

So too, the restlessness which leads a man or woman to take the first steps towards faith, or to reinforce the initial faith which has already been given, is also God’s gift. From whatever perspective we view things it is God who is both the source and the goal of all our searching and striving.",

The story is told of two scientists who were admiring a perfectly constructed model of the whole solar system. One asked the other: ‘Who made it?’ The other, knowing that his colleague was a professed non-believer, replied: ‘Nobody made it. It just happened.’ The former did not appreciate being made fun of, and said as much.

            "These arguments against faith are not new. In the second century, a writer called Celsus argued that Christianity was full of ‘fairy tales’ and childish beliefs. Perhaps what is new is the sense of militantism associated with this ‘new atheism’. In some parts of the world, an advertising campaign was undertaken with signs on public transport saying, ‘Relax. There is no God. Go ahead and enjoy yourself.’ One Christian thinker suggested that the Christian churches should respond with a similar sign: ‘Relax. There is a God. Go ahead and enjoy yourself.’",
            "One might well ask how many real atheists there are in the world. Certainly there are many practical atheists, that is, people who choose to live as though God does not exist, who prefer not to think about it. There are also many who would sincerely classify themselves as agnostics – people who suspend belief because they are unable to decide one way or the other from the apparently conflicting evidence which they find confronting them. It must also be said that doubt is distinct from a denial of faith. As some of the great mystics and spiritual writers throughout history have expressed, doubt is a companion of faith. It can be the doorway that leads to a deeper faith.",
            "A believer will argue that it is much easier to believe in God than not. The Bible has harsh words for non-believers. The Psalmist states Fools say in their hearts, ‘There is no God’ (Psalm 14:1). And Paul, writing to the Romans, says that the pagans are without excuse for failing to recognise the existence of a Creator from the wonderful things which God has made. Ever since the creation of the world his eternal power and divine nature, invisible though they are, have been understood and seen through the things he has made. So they are without excuse … (Romans 1:20).",
            "But how numerous are the convinced theoretical atheists? In recent years, some prominent atheists have become increasingly vocal. Publications such as Richard Dawkins’ The God Delusion (2006) and Christopher Hitchens’ God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything (2007) have presented a public challenge to religious faith. In these works, faith in a divine being is dismissed as infantile, divisive and destructive. For Dawkins, Hitchens and other publicly-avowed atheists, only the rational and scientifically discernible world is credible. Any statement of faith beyond this is a delusion. Dawkins, Hitchens and companions are best understood as social iconoclasts attempting to shatter what they see as illusions and shadows opposed to human reason. Rather than exorcising religion from the public realm, these debates have only served to keep religious faith on centre stage.",
            "Fundamentalist beliefs, whether theistic or atheistic, are destructive. What these latest arguments against faith fail to take into account is the significant intellectual tradition which has accompanied the search for faith and God. Faith and reason go hand in hand. Our Catholic tradition holds that there is a discernible Presence which, in part, can be discovered through a reasoned exploration of the world and the human person. Faith and reason are not enemies but necessary companions. Science and religion are partners in the search for truth."

            "In one area of human tragedies, the question is not so difficult to answer. The plain fact is that most of the evil is man-made. It is the tragic result of our abuse of that freedom which is one of God’s greatest gifts to us. For God to prevent such evil would necessitate the withdrawal of that gift of freedom, and this would in effect mean taking away our human nature.",
            "In creating us as intelligent, free beings, God knew that we would abuse our intelligence and freedom, and this is what has constantly been the case throughout the whole history of the human race. We cannot therefore hold God responsible for all the evil in the world, the evil which is the result of human sin.",
            "Therefore the question which inevitably arises is this: if there exists a God who is good and loving and merciful, how could such a God permit evil and injustice and suffering? How can we reconcile the existence of a good and loving and merciful God with the evil and injustice and suffering that are so much a part of a world created by God?",
            "Admittedly there are problems about the argument for the existence of God from the beauty of creation, and the order and harmony in nature. For not all creation is beautiful and harmonious. There is also an ugliness and a wildness and a savagery in nature – earthquakes, famines, drought, floods, storms and tempests. There is also all too often an ugliness in the affairs of human beings, in the way they treat one another – wars, persecutions, racism, and various other forms of injustice, exploitation and oppression."

Our human horizons are limited, and we can see only a restricted area of the total reality. The infinite mind of God sees the whole picture, while we can see only a tiny piece of the canvas. How particular disasters and tragedies fit into God’s overall plan we often cannot hope to grasp.",
            "People often become bewildered and angry when confronted with tragedies for which there seems no natural explanation or moral justification. At such times, there is the natural tendency to blame God for apparent cruelty or lack of concern. We find this reaction often expressed in the pages of the Bible, especially the Old Testament. The Book of Job is the fullest biblical treatment of the problem of suffering. It is the story of an innocent man who gradually loses everything. Chapters 39 to 42 of this book give us a powerful presentation of this problem. Although he does not understand, Job grows into a peaceful acceptance and serenity, so that in spite of his misfortune he can still say Blessed be the name of the Lord.",

            "To appeal to the experience of Jesus at this point is to anticipate a little, but it needs to be said here that the Christian is in a much better position to understand and to accept the problem of suffering in the world. Jesus renounced a life of comfort and security, but instead emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, and humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death – even death on a cross (Philippians 2:7-8). He freely came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many (Matthew 20:28).",
            "As with Job and the psalmist, there was the natural human reaction on Jesus’ part, too, to the suffering that his mission involved. He prayed to his Father on the night before his death: for you all things are possible; remove this cup from me (Mark 14:36). In the midst of his suffering on the cross, he cried out in anguish: My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? (Mark 15:34). But even in his agony of fear he signified his acceptance of God’s will (Mark 14:36), and among his last words on the cross was a prayer that expressed his serenity: Father, into your hands I commend my spirit (Luke 23:46).",
            "The Christian can find in Jesus a companion in the midst of the most severe sufferings, for his cross was very much a part of our suffering world. The author of the letter to the Hebrews emphasises the identification of Jesus with us when he refers to him as one who is able to sympathise with our weaknesses, because we have one who in every respect has been tested as we are, yet without sin (4:15); moreover, he learned obedience through what he suffered (5:8). The suffering of Jesus was life-giving and productive of great good for humanity. By reflecting on his experience, we can begin to see that suffering can have a rich and positive value.",
            "Although there are mysteries we cannot hope to fathom in this life, and questions we cannot answer, we need to look at all the evidence – good as well as evil, joy as well as suffering. The human mind can discover God’s goodness in the beauty of the world created for our benefit and enjoyment, and in God’s gifts of life and love. Suffering is only part of the human experience, but even the pain, suffering and evil that are part of the fabric of our lives can speak to us of God. There is a strange mixture of joy and sadness in our experience, in which we can sometimes glimpse a life-giving pattern. At times, suffering is a prelude to real happiness. Overall, the problems and difficulties associated with human existence are not enough to outweigh all the evidence for the existence of a good and loving God."

            "Throughout human history people have formed different images of God. God has not always been seen as a personal being, but sometimes as one or other of the impersonal forces of nature. People have worshipped the sun, thunder and lightning as their gods. They have fashioned for themselves their own gods, idols of gold and silver and bronze which they have worshipped. At times in history, they have imagined the existence of a whole host of gods, often in conflict with one another. And still today, there are those who can go no further than speak of some higher power.",

Sometimes they conceived their gods as angry, vindictive masters, whom they felt they had to placate and appease by the offering of sacrifices, even human sacrifices. At other times they thought of the gods as superior beings who regarded humans as mere playthings to have sport with, gods who acted capriciously and according to their whims.",
            "Only rarely could they conceive of a god or gods who were really interested or cared about the welfare of mere individual mortals. This is true of some ‘believers’ in God today. They see God as a kind of divine watchmaker, who set the world in motion in the beginning but now sits idly by; just letting things take their course (this way of understanding God is called ‘Deism’). We can imagine this picture of a god sitting in the grandstand, watching the game of human history unfold, but taking no active part or even any active interest in the affairs and foibles of people. Could there be any more monstrous conception than this, of a do-nothing, detached god? Surely it would be more logical to deny the existence of any higher power, than to accept the existence of such a deity."

A God who chose them: you shall be my people, and I will be your God (Ezekiel 36:28). God wanted their love and obedience and service, but also their happiness and prosperity.",

As we become more familiar with the Scriptures, we will come to appreciate more the depth and tenderness of God’s love for us – God’s own people. God’s relationship is sometimes described in terms of a relationship between father and son, at other times, between bridegroom and bride. Without this revelation on God’s part, we could never have come to know the extent of God’s love for us.",

By getting to know Jesus Christ, we experience God’s love and mercy in a way we otherwise would never even suspect. His whole life was the love of God in action. As we look at the cross of Christ, we see God’s love revealed in all its clarity.",

By seeing the works and hearing the words of the man Jesus, we gain an insight into the character of God that was otherwise unknown and unknowable – God’s love, compassion and mercy, God’s care and concern for individuals, especially the poor, the sick, the weak, the outcasts, those whom Jesus called God’s ‘little ones’."

        "The activity that we call prayer can hardly be made the object of a commandment. If two people have to be commanded to talk to each other, their relationship obviously does not have a lot going for it. Besides, it will not work. Perhaps two people can be made to speak words to each other, but they cannot be made to communicate. This happens only when they want to share something with each other. Communication is one of the expressions of love.",
        "Paul teaches this truth with his usual bluntness: the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but that very Spirit intercedes with sighs too deep for words. And God, who searches the heart, knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God (Romans 8:26-27). In other words, prayer is what the Spirit of God produces in us, and God knows the mind of the Spirit – and what is in our minds, and what are our needs.",
        "When Jesus talked about prayer he revealed to us its unsuspected depths, and he spoke about God’s side of the communication.",
        "The first thing we should note about prayer is that it is a gift. It is God who speaks first. Prayer is not something we do in order to get in touch with God, but rather it is God’s gift to us. We cannot pray unless God opens our minds and moves our hearts and attracts us to God’s own self.",
        "That may come as a surprise to many people and may even be somewhat deflating to hear. We tend to think of prayer as our business, our activity. Yet on reflection, we will come to see it as an encouraging truth and even a great relief. We are indeed responsible adults who must make it through each day, and yet we are also God’s children, walking along hand in hand with God, in total and peaceful dependence."

            "So the first purpose of our prayer is to learn to pray as Jesus did. In describing his Transfiguration, Luke tells us that while he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became dazzling white (9:29). In Jesus’ case this was the divine glory shining through his humanity. In our case it should be the spirit of Jesus taking over our minds and hearts.",
            "The best model of prayer we have is Jesus himself. The writer of the Letter to the Hebrews reflects on Jesus’ life of prayer: In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered; and having been made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him (5:7-9).",
            "He kept on saying Abba (the tender but strong word of a loving son or daughter), for you all things are possible; remove this cup from me; yet, not what I want, but what you want (Mark 14:36). Luke tells us that an angel appeared to him from heaven to strengthen him – a way of describing his Father’s comforting him. And yet in his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground (Luke 22:43-44). One of the best aids to prayer is to try to enter into Jesus’ feelings at different occasions of his life, for his human feelings are our feelings too.",
            "We are told that at the beginning of his ministry, the Spirit drove him into the desert to enter into deep communion with his Father over a period of 40 days. Luke’s Gospel is the Gospel which tells us most about the prayer of Jesus. He tells us that Jesus often retired to isolated places to pray. We are given a glimpse of him at prayer before or during some of the most crucial events of his life: after his baptism, before choosing the Twelve, alone on the mountain in hiding from people who wanted to proclaim him their king, and above all, during his agony of fear in the garden of Gethsemane the night before his death."

            "Although we should try to imitate the prayer of Jesus, prayer is also the most personal thing we do. Just as no two sets of fingerprints in the world are alike, and no two persons are exactly the same, so too in prayer; no two people communicate with God in the same way. God has a unique relationship with each and every one of us, just as we have unique relationships with each one of our friends. It is not just that our love for some is deeper and stronger than for others, but that each relationship has a different spirit and tone and style.",
            "Prayer requires no set of directions, just as true friends do not need a script when they meet. This is not to belittle the advice of spiritual writers who suggest techniques to use to keep our minds from distractions, or to keep us quiet enough to hear what God is saying.",
            "Once I can come to this consciousness of a face-to-face contact with God’s presence, the response which is called for on my part is obvious. Unless I have picked up false guidance somewhere along the way, I can be confident, calm and secure. Certainly I am aware of my sinfulness, but shame and guilt are not my main feelings. Instead I feel gratitude and assurance. In deep humility I acknowledge my complete dependence on God for every breath I take and my very existence. In the words of Benedictine Brother David Steindl-Rast, all is gift.",
            "When I pray, I am alone with my God. As C.S. Lewis once wrote, The prayer preceding all prayers is, ‘May it be the real I who speaks. May it be the real Thou that I speak to’. I know I cannot pretend to be anything other than I am, because God knows me better than I know myself. There is no room and no point for the camouflage and the masks I may put on in my relationship with others. I am myself, with nothing hidden from God, but also with nothing that God does not care for. It is preparing oneself for prayer that is the real problem, rather than the actual praying. Jesus presumably did not have this same problem, because he was always ready for prayer.",
            "The point is that prayer is a conversation with God, and there can be no true dialogue when one person holds the floor or monopolises the conversation. Prayer must also involve a listening to God. Moreover, Jesus wanted to teach that prayer is best when it is simple, and it is simple when it heeds the advice given in Psalm 46:10: Be still, and know that I am God.",
            "Now that we have grasped the value of ‘the prayer of quiet’, we may be surprised to hear that we should pester God for what we want! Yet this is precisely what we are told in the Gospel parable of the man who visits his friend late at night to borrow food because of the arrival of unexpected guests (Luke 11:5-8). It has been well said that if this story of the nocturnal nuisance were not in the Gospels, no one would ever dare invent it.",
            "After saying these words he taught his disciples the Lord’s Prayer or Our Father (Matthew 6:9-13). In doing so, it was not his intention to give them words to memorise, although we have naturally and understandably done this, because we treasure these words that come from Jesus. But rather than teach them a formula to recite, he wanted to give them a model and a spirit of prayer – an expression of total and child-like dependence on God as the giver of all gifts, which is what the ‘Our Father’ is.",
            "Jesus warned in the same context (Matthew 6:7-8) against the idea that the value of our prayer depends on the quantity of words we utter: When you are praying, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.",
            "We can certainly follow Jesus’ advice in the Sermon on the Mount to go into your room and shut the door (Matthew 6:6). It will not matter what we say in our private encounter with God. Indeed it may even be better not to say anything."

He decided to go to his friend’s house down the road, and knocked on his friend’s door. The sleeping arrangements in a poor Palestinian household meant that the door was bolted, and a sleeping mat was probably placed against the door. The family has been asleep for hours, and it would have been a major operation even to open the door, to say nothing of waking the whole household.",
            "The disturbed friend’s immediate reaction was to say: Do not bother me; the door has already been locked. But the knocking continued, for the petitioner was sure that his pleas would be answered for friendship’s sake. Finally, Jesus says, the man of the house gave in, and at great inconvenience to himself, his wife and his children, opened the door and shoved a loaf of bread into the hands of his friend in the darkness.",
            "Not surprisingly, it is Luke who reports a similar parable of Jesus in 18:1-5. There he tells the story, again not without humour, of an unscrupulous judge who finally gave in to the persistence of a victimised widow not because he had any conscience about justice, but because he could no longer stand the woman’s complaints.",
            "The daring aspect of these parables lies in the comparison they make between God and a reluctant giver, and even between God and a corrupt judge. Of course we are not meant to apply these parables so literally as to picture God in either of these roles. But Jesus says we must pester the Father in the same way, secure in the knowledge God cannot become exasperated nor deny justice to those who call on him.",
            "But for what do we petition God? What should be the aim of our persistence and perseverance in prayer? In his own model of Christian prayer, Jesus teaches us to say Hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Perhaps this would not be our list of priorities. Probably we would put our daily bread first. But anyway, what does it mean?",
            "At our best moments – moments of real prayer, or on a crowded bus – we want first things first. We do love our Father, and – empowered by God’s Spirit, and with the example of Jesus before us – like all lovers we want first of all the good and the well-being of the one we love.",
            "The Lord’s Prayer also implies a cooperation on our part to help bring about God’s kingdom of justice, love and peace – God acts through people. We cannot pray the Lord’s Prayer sincerely unless we are committed to helping achieve what God’s kingdom envisages.",
            "According to Luke, Jesus told this humorous story to teach the need for persistence in prayer.",
            "God’s ‘name’ is God’s own person. God cannot be ‘hallowed’ or made holy, being already the perfection of holiness. When we pray, Hallowed be your name, we want God to be seen as holy, accepted as holy, honoured as holy by all God’s children, all members of the human race. We want God’s kingdom to come, so that God’s love may capture the minds and hearts of all people. We want God’s will to be done, so that all may experience the healing and forgiveness, the freedom which God wills, and the happiness that follows. It also means of course that we want the secular powers to cooperate with God’s grace, so that the whole human family might experience these benefits."

For what should we ask? While we acknowledge that we should ask that God’s name be held as holy, that God’s will might be done and that God’s reign might become a reality on earth as in heaven, are we justified in asking for such mundane things as a job, a home, a husband or a wife, or a healing from some illness?",
            "The answer to these questions, in the light of the parables of Luke 11:5-8 and 18:1-5, is surely ‘Yes’. However, the standard of our asking should be the one we use with our best friends, those we most deeply love. If we truly love another person, then a sign and quality of that love is unselfishness. Love and selfishness cannot coexist. Real love means that we want the good of the other first.",

The more we realise we need something – health, forgiveness, employment, or whatever – the more we realise our helplessness.",

            "Jesus has just begun his public ministry and made an immediate impression on the people. We are told that crowds flocked to his door. But in the early hours of the morning, he slipped off to a lonely place to be by himself with God in prayer.",
            "The other incident is described in Mark 6:30 (and following). The Twelve had just returned from the missionary tour on which Jesus had sent them (6:7). They were filled with excitement at what they had achieved. Again, his response to their enthusiastic reporting was to invite them to come away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest a while. Although prayer is not mentioned explicitly, this is surely what was behind Jesus’ invitation.",
            "In his book Believing in Jesus, Father Leonard Foley mentions an astute observation by Ann Lindbergh. She once wrote that if her friends called to invite her to a party and she told them she had an appointment with the hairdresser, they would consider that a perfectly valid reason for not attending. But if she said she needed time for prayer, they would have been quite puzzled and unimpressed.",
            "So it is with prayer. Although we may do our work in the peaceful awareness of God’s presence, we can easily become absorbed by that work. Our love needs to be nourished, kept alive and stimulated by times when we do nothing but communicate with God. This is illustrated again by a couple of episodes in the Gospel of Mark. The first occurs in chapter one.",
            "Without that ‘reserved’ time from our busy schedules – fifteen minutes or half an hour or even an hour, if we are fortunate enough to be able to afford that amount of time – we can easily become undernourished, less committed, less fervent. The way we pray is less important than the fact that we do it. Spending time in prayer necessarily means that we forego other activities and experiences. We must make a choice and still our restlessness. As one spiritual writer, Fr. Ron Rolheiser observed: Because prayer can seem unreal, we often stop doing it, but it will only seem real if we persevere in it long enough and do it deeply enough. We often give up too soon. Prayer isn’t easy. It’s hard to sit still and (seemingly) do nothing when so many necessary tasks demand our attention and when so much inside us aches for activity and involvement. It’s hard to pray when we suffer from the kind of headaches and heartaches that cannot be eased by taking an Aspirin. But prayer beckons us beyond, asking us to lift even this up to God.",
            "Mark tells us how Simon (Peter) and his other disciples went in search of him. Their remarks when they found him carry a hint of disapproval and rebuke: Everyone is searching for you (Mark 1:37). It is apparent that they considered Jesus’ withdrawal for prayer to be a tactical error. Surely he should have been cashing in on his newly-won popularity. They failed to appreciate his need for quiet time to be alone with his Father in prayer (see Mark 1:35-39).",
            "Whether or not we are people of prayer will be a reflection of our lives. If our life is faith-filled, then it is itself a prayer; if our prayer is genuine, then our life is faith-filled. This is how it is for all who love. Just to be in the same place as the one loved is in itself a source of pleasure and satisfaction. But it is not enough. For friends and lovers also want to reserve certain times when they do nothing but communicate with each other and really be with each other."

In so many situations, familiar prayers – whether known by heart or read from a book – are an important guide and a source of strength.",
            "Many people, however, prefer to pray in a less formal and more spontaneous way. Their prayer has no set form, and may not involve words at all. It may be simply silence in the presence of God, or it may follow some pattern. It is as hard to describe in any systematic way as a conversation between friends.",
            "Such informal spontaneous prayer may need a focus, something on which to fasten one’s thoughts. Prayerful reading of the Scriptures may provide a good starting point. In this context, we are not reading for purposes of study, or to gain information or because we find the subject interesting. The aim is rather to listen to the voice of God so that we can respond with prayer.",

It gives a concrete form to expressions of faith and love, and frees one from the worry of ‘making up’ what one wants to say.",
            "A simple form of such prayer is Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me. There are many short and simple prayers of this kind in the Scriptures which one may use: Lord, I believe, help my unbelief; Come, Lord Jesus, Come; Be it done to me according to your word. Another obvious example is the traditional ‘doxology’ or prayer of praise: Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end!",

It is only when we admit our creaturehood and our ‘nothingness’ in comparison with God that we can become ‘something’ through God’s grace. This means an attitude of complete trust in God – often in silence, and even in the absence of any ‘enjoyment’.",
            "Everyone with any experience of prayer will know that very often it is plain hard work. This is the reason why so many people will find any number of excuses to avoid prayer or at least put it off. We will find a hundred different things to do before beginning to pray. In this we are in good company, because even great saints and mystics have confessed that often they did not find it easy to pray.",
            "Our prayer response may be in the form of adoration, praise or thanksgiving. It may take the form of expressing sorrow for sin. Again, it may be petition for one’s own needs or those of others. It may in fact be anything, as long as it comes from the heart.",
            "A form of prayer which has received much renewed emphasis in recent years is the so-called ‘Jesus prayer’. To some extent, this has been due to the influence of Eastern spirituality and involves the creative use of what used to be called ‘aspirations’. It is prayer which has the advantage of simplicity and is meant to be repeated, rhythmically, without haste and from the heart. Because of its rhythmic character, it is often called ‘breath prayer’ or ‘breathing prayer’."

In the same way, friendship provides many benefits, but if these were the sole purpose for cultivating a friendship, there is really no friendship at all but only a business relationship. Some of the great saints wrote in their spiritual diaries of times of dryness, when God seemed remote and prayer itself was a tedious process. St John of the Cross spoke of ‘the dark night of the soul’. In our prayer, we have to learn patience to travel the weary path that takes us through the dry places.",
            "Merton and others have said that we must be prepared to ‘waste time’ with God and for God; that is, we must be willing to give time to God absolutely, simply because God is our loving creator to whom we owe everything. It is not self-hatred but a simple statement of the deepest reality to say: ‘God is all, I am nothing’. I know deep down that I am precious in God’s sight but that is because God has made me so, and all the honour and praise belongs to God.",
            "Spiritual writers have remarked that these dry stretches can almost be seen as a sign of progress in prayer, as we are drawn more and more into the mystery of the cross and share that experience which caused Jesus to cry out: My God, why have you abandoned me? (Matthew 27:46).",
            "So prayer may come down to just ‘wasting time’ before God, that is, remaining in God’s presence without being concerned about any personal benefit, but simply being able to say You are my God. You are my all. I adore you. I love you.",
            "Our prayer may come down to simply being in the presence of God. This may not always be a source of satisfaction for us, but it can lead to a real sense of what it means to depend on God. Thomas Merton, one of the great spiritual directors and writers of the twentieth century, warned that prayer cannot be measured in terms of ‘usefulness’. In other words, its value cannot be calculated on the basis of ‘what we get out of it’, or whether we have a series of emotional ‘highs’ or come to clear conclusions. When these things happen, it is a bonus and reason for gratitude, but prayer is above all a matter of complete self-surrender."

The usual answer given to these questions has been in the writings of the Bible and in the Tradition of the Church (from a Latin word, trāditiō, meaning ‘to pass’ or ‘hand on’). This is a view shared by all the major Christian churches, because we all look to the Bible as the main source of the basic truths of Christianity and each church has its own tradition.",

The New Testament narratives about Jesus emerge from an already active process of ‘traditioning’. Prior to the written forms, there were oral traditions about the words and deeds of Jesus. The written forms (Scripture) developed from a process of communal formation (Tradition). Scripture and Tradition are all part of the same process. God’s truth is one and indivisible, and the Bible and the Church are closely related to each other. The Tradition of the Church is really the teaching Church’s official interpretation of the Scripture. The Church’s ongoing understanding and exposition of the truth contained in Scripture is what makes up Tradition."

To be exact, our Catholic editions of the Bible comprise 73 books, 46 of which make up what we call the Old Testament (the Scriptures of the people of Israel), and 27 which comprise the New Testament. We might just note at this point that Protestant versions of the Bible contain 66 books, acknowledging only 39 Old Testament books as the true word of God, seven fewer than are found in the Catholic Bible. This is because Catholics follow the early Greek manuscripts of the Bible, while Protestants accept only the books found in the ancient Hebrew manuscripts. However, in some recent ecumenical editions of the Bible, these seven disputed books are included in a separate section.",

The oldest parts of the Hebrew Scriptures were written about 1,000 years before Christ, and the last of the New Testament books was written about 100 AD. So the books of the Bible were written over a period of about 1,100 years.",

            "We Christians can look back on the whole of salvation history up to the present time, and see that an event like the Exodus was just one of a whole series of interventions by God, but the fact that it happened so long ago and concerned directly the people of Israel does not make it any less real or important. It is as real an act of God’s redemption as is the death and resurrection of Christ. So we must not neglect its importance and significance for our Christian faith."

The books of the Old Testament were produced over a great span of time, and in some cases even a single book took many centuries to reach the form in which we have it today. This is true of the first five books of the Bible, the five books which the Jews call their ‘Torah’ or law, and which they regard as the most important part of their sacred writings. They are the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. It used to be thought that these books were largely the work of one man, Moses. But now we know they did not reach their final form until about 500 BC, many centuries after the death of Moses.",
            "This makes the Bible difficult at times to understand. If we could say that each book had a single author, and if we knew the identity of each author and knew exactly each one’s cultural background, then the task of interpreting the Bible would become much simpler. But this is not the case. And of course the books of the Bible were written by people from a very different cultural background and with a different mentality from our own.",
            "In fact they were composed by many people who collected different strands of ancient tradition. In the early stages and for a long time, the stories about Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Joseph and Moses, which are the content of these books, were handed on from generation to generation by word of mouth, before they ever came to be written down. Later on, different editors gathered these traditions together, and forged them into some kind of unity. The same goes for several other books of the Old Testament as well."

The very word ‘testament’ means ‘covenant’, and the Old Testament as a whole is a record of the history of Israel in the light of the covenant made at Sinai. It is a sad tale, on the whole, of their continued breaking of the covenant, their recurring infidelity, and of God’s fidelity despite their disobedience. We find running through the Old Testament this cycle of infidelity, punishment, repentance and new beginning."

This happened about 600 years before Christ.",

They began to preach the gospel and to attract large numbers of converts to this new religious movement. They proclaimed the message of salvation brought by Jesus first to the Jewish people, and in doing so they also made use of the scriptures which had long been sacred to the Jews – what we call the Old Testament. Like their fellow Jews and their Jewish ancestors, the followers of Jesus accepted these scriptures as the word of God. In quoting from these scriptures in his early sermons, Peter would say: This is how the Holy Spirit spoke through the mouths of the prophets in days of old (2 Peter 1:19-21)."

They make no distinction for practical purposes between religious, scientific and historical truth, but interpret the book of Genesis, for example, as though it were a scientific text, arguing that it is a matter of faith that God actually created the universe in six 24-hour days, and that our world is less than 5000 years old.",
            "The fundamentalist approach is poles apart from the principles laid down by the Church for the interpretation of Scripture. Because of the dogmatism of their teaching and their black-and-white approach to matters of faith and morality – based on their literalist understanding of Scripture – the fundamentalist churches have made significant inroads into the mainline churches. They appeal especially to those seeking security and clear answers in a world of such rapid and destabilising change. This phenomenon highlights how urgent it is that the major churches provide for their members opportunities for adult faith education in the area of Scripture."

            "We must also acknowledge that when we are reading the Scriptures with faith, we can expect the help and the grace of the Holy Spirit. What we should not expect (or fear) is that the Spirit will lead us in our prayerful reading of the Scriptures in a direction contrary to that which is the mind of the Church. We should read and pray the Scriptures in the company of the Church, that is, as members of a believing community which is guided by the same Holy Spirit in its search for truth. Catholics still enjoy great freedom in their understanding of particular biblical passages and in how they apply them to their own life-situation. We rightly recognise the Church as the rightful interpreter of the Scriptures for us, but there are very few texts in the whole Bible whose meaning the Church has formally declared as the one which Catholics must hold. Two that come to mind are the ‘words of institution’ at the end of the Last Supper (Matthew 26:26-27 and parallels) and the ‘primacy of Peter’ text of Matthew (16:17-19). For the rest, we are free to take from them any meaning or application which does not come into conflict with the totality of the faith.",
            "It would be wrong however to think that the Scriptures can be used with spiritual benefit only by those who have the opportunity to study them in depth. We have to distinguish between the study and the prayerful reading of Scripture. While a knowledge of the Scriptures, and the contexts in which the different books were written is a definite plus, it is still possible for the most uneducated person who reads them in a spirit of faith to derive from them great spiritual nourishment.",
            "When reading the Gospels, for example, many people have found it very useful to imagine that they are participants in the particular episode which is being described, or among the audience listening to Jesus as he speaks. This is not make-believe, because we recall that the Gospels were written not to satisfy people’s curiosity about the details of Jesus’ life but to challenge their readers to come to faith in him. The evangelists would have intended their readers to see words addressed to Mary or Peter or Pilate or Judas as addressed also to them.",
            "In conclusion, we might choose just one quotation from the Vatican Council’s document Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation to illustrate the importance which the Church attaches to the Scriptures: The Church has always venerated the divine Scriptures as she venerated the body of the Lord, in so far as she never ceases, particularly in the sacred liturgy, to partake of the bread of life and to offer it to the faithful from the one table of the word of God and the body of Christ (no 21). Both the Scriptures and the eucharistic Body of Christ are the bread of life which gives us the nourishment that leads to eternal life."

Many people not affiliated with any of the world’s great religions have come to recognise God’s existence, power and goodness, simply by the exercise of their own powers of reasoning. They have come to know God by reflecting on the works of God’s creation, and on the order and beauty they see in the world around them.",
        "Over and above this, however, Christians claim to have the benefit of God’s self-revelation in the pages of the Bible, God’s own word. We know God as revealed in the Old Testament. With the Jews, with whom we share the Old Testament, we see God revealed there as a personal God of love, goodness, power, justice and mercy. But Christians are also the beneficiaries of the further revelation which God has given in the New Testament, through the personal witness of Jesus who declared himself to be the Son of God."

            "Even though the phrases ‘son of God’, ‘sons of God’, are found in the Old Testament (for example, to describe the king or angels; and even the people of Israel as a whole is called God’s first-born son), the expression is used only in a metaphorical sense. It was certainly not intended to be understood in the same way that Jesus spoke of himself as God’s Son, when for example, he said I and the Father are one (John 10:30).",
            "We call this doctrine of the Trinity a mystery of faith. It is a truth which our finite minds could never discover unless God had chosen to reveal it to us. Before Christ, this truth was unknown. The Jews had no concept of a God of three persons, although the Hebrew scriptures do contain hints of a sense of plurality in God and suggestions of divergent understandings and traditions. However, overall, the Jews were fiercely monotheistic and would have found such a concept very difficult to accept, because it would seem to put at risk their belief in God’s oneness, a truth that was so basic to their religion. Their pagan neighbours were polytheists, worshippers of many gods. This practice was abhorrent to the Jews. Their monotheism or belief in one God was the distinctive mark which set them apart, and made their worship so much superior to the idolatrous practices of other peoples. From John’s Gospel especially we learn that fellow Jews on several occasions accused Jesus of blasphemy because they understood his claim to be equal to his Father as a claim to be God.",
            "What we can discover in the teaching of Jesus, is that God, though one, is a God of three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. From the New Testament evidence, the Church later formulated the doctrine of the Trinity, a dogma which Catholics are obliged to believe. (A ‘dogma’ is a central doctrine, understood to be ‘divinely revealed’ taught with the fullest solemnity.) The teaching Church stated this doctrine in these terms: that God is one; that there is in God only one nature; that there are in God three persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, distinct from one another and equal in every respect. All the mainstream Christian churches accept this dogma of faith."

For example, when Luke describes God’s messenger Gabriel saying to Mary: The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called Son of God (Luke 1:35), there is no reason to believe that he was thinking of a personal divine being. ‘The Holy Spirit’ and ‘the power of the Most High’ are one and the same thing.",
            "Even after Jesus’ revelation of this truth, and the Church’s later expression of it, this doctrine of the Trinity remains a mystery of faith which defies full comprehension by the human mind. We will have more to say about the Trinity when we come to talk about the part played by the Holy Spirit in our life as Christians.",
            "It is in John’s Gospel, the last of the four to be written, that the Spirit is clearly designated as a person, or at least personified. Jesus speaks of the Spirit in this way in the lengthy farewell address to the disciples at the Last Supper, reported by John in chapters 14, 15 and 16. (See, for example, John 14:26). And by the time Matthew’s Gospel was written, probably in the 80’s of the first century, the Christians of his place had evidently come to accept the Spirit as a personal being on a par with the Father and the Son. As part of the final instructions of the risen Christ to his disciples at the moment of his departure, Matthew reports him as commanding them to baptise believers in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19).",
            "Similarly, the spirit of God is mentioned frequently in the Old Testament. But again, it was never understood in the Christian sense of a member of a trinity of divine persons. For the Jews, the spirit or breath of God was simply another way of describing the power of God. It was the spirit of God which hovered over the primeval chaos at the moment of creation, and brought order and life out of the formless mass. And God’s spirit or power is often said to fill, or move, or seize, or fall upon prophets and other leading Old Testament personalities, motivating and impelling them to speak God’s truth or carry out God’s will."

Like the way the mystery of the Trinity is formulated, this is again an attempt to express in human terms what is a profound mystery of faith.",
            "Standing alongside the doctrine of the Trinity, in importance, is the doctrine which is called the Incarnation. This truth, again deduced from the words of Jesus and from the New Testament as a whole, is that one of the persons of the Trinity, namely the Son, at a given moment in human history, nearly 2000 years ago, became a human being like us, Jesus of Nazareth. The word ‘incarnation’ means ‘the taking on of a human nature’. The Son of God became incarnate, became fully human, while not ceasing to be God.",

In the New Testament, the Father is usually named as the one who initiates the process: ‘God sent his Son into the world’, or ‘God gave his Son ...’",
            "Every person is a mystery, and no one can ever know all there is to know about another. If this is true of our knowledge of one another, it is all the more true of our knowledge of God. Even though God has told us something about the divine nature by revealing the mysteries of the Trinity and the Incarnation, our understanding of these mysteries of faith is never complete. They call for a continuing and ever deeper search for understanding on our part. The words the Church has used to express these mysteries of faith are rich in meaning, and true expressions of the reality as far as they go, but they can never do justice to the reality.",

            "There are several possible answers to this basic question, which has been debated at length by theologians throughout the whole history of the Church. The traditional answer is that the Son of God became human to take upon himself the whole guilt and responsibility for human sin, and to atone for that sin by offering himself as a sacrifice on the Cross to God the Father. This is the explanation found in the earliest Christian tradition, in the writings of Paul and the first three Gospels.",
            "The idea is that sin is an offence against God, and is therefore of the utmost gravity and seriousness. Human beings alone could not atone for an offence against an all-holy God. It was therefore necessary for God to take this course of action, because the only way adequate reparation could be made to God was through one who – while fully human – was also himself a divine being. The sacrifice of Jesus, at the same time Son of God and the perfect, representative human, thus had an infinite power and was alone able to repair the injury committed against God by the world’s sin. This theological model of atonement found its most systematic expression in the works of St Anselm in the 11th century and was to shape centuries of theological reflection.",

There is abundant evidence in the Old Testament that they recognised the God of Israel as a God of love.

When we look at the cross of Jesus and reflect on its meaning, we see the love of God revealed in full clarity.",

The author of the Book of Genesis describes God’s creation of man and woman as the perfection of the creative work, but the subsequent narrative shows us how humanity’s surrender to the power of sin caused this image of perfection to be badly tarnished. It soon became obvious that men and women needed to be raised from their state of sinfulness if they were to live as God intended them to live.",

As a result of the life and ministry and teaching of Jesus, God is no longer a remote, transcendent Being, separated from us by an unbridgeable gap, but someone who shares our life. When we see Jesus in action and listen to his words, we receive a much clearer and deeper insight into God’s own character, what God is really like. We learn especially that this is a God who knows each creature as an individual; a God who loves and cares for each one of us; who has a special concern for the weak, the sick, the suffering, those whom Jesus called God’s ‘little ones’; and who is a God of mercy and compassion, who desires the conversion of the sinner and takes special delight in forgiving."

Jesus was born more than 2000 years ago, in the little town of Bethlehem, in Judaea (the southern part of present day Israel). His mother was a Jewish girl named Mary from the village of Nazareth, in Galilee (in the north of modern Israel). The Gospels of Matthew and Luke both refer to the miraculous nature of his conception. We are told that Jesus had no natural human father, but that Mary conceived her son by the supernatural intervention of the Holy Spirit. Mary at the time was preparing to marry a man named Joseph, to whom God revealed the extraordinary circumstances of his fiancee’s pregnancy. Then Joseph consented to take Mary as his wife, and become the legal father of the child. The child was given the name Jesus (in Hebrew, Yeshua or Yehoshua), a name which means ‘God saves’."

It was about two hundred and forty kilometres from north to south and one hundred kilometres from east to west. Only on a couple of occasions did Jesus move outside the borders of his own country – and even then, he did not go very far beyond them. He was therefore seen and heard by relatively few people in a very small area.",

Given the timing of his incarnation, would it not have made more sense if he were born in Rome, the capital of the civilized world?",
        "Instead, he was born in the humblest of circumstances in one of the most remote corners of the Roman Empire.

Nazareth must have been a real backwater, if we are to judge from the comment of Nathaniel in John 1:46: Can anything good come out of Nazareth?",

Even then, it was a humble appearance, for he came forward with other penitents to ask John the Baptist for baptism. It was John who was inspired by God to point him out to the people as the one whom God had sent. Only then did Jesus begin his preaching and healing ministry.",

And even those who knew Jesus was innocent of the charges which had brought him to death, felt a deep sense of disappointment at the premature end to a life which had promised so much. The hopes that they had placed in him were shattered.",

By saying that his work was incomplete, we do not suggest that there was any deficiency in himself, or that his sacrifice was of limited value. No, it was a deliberate incompleteness. Clearly, God’s plan was that the task of the Son was to begin a work which others were to carry on. This conclusion is inescapable when we read the Gospel records of how Jesus went about his mission."

            "After his introduction (Mark 1:1-13) and the first public appearance of Jesus announcing the coming of the kingdom (1:14-15), Mark immediately describes the call of the two pairs of brothers, Simon and Andrew, and James and John (1:16-20). According to Mark, this was the first thing Jesus did after beginning his public life – which, in itself, is a clear indication of the important part the disciples are to play.",
            "During the first part of his Gospel (the first eight chapters), Mark reports the popularity of Jesus with the crowds, who are attracted to him because of his miracles and his teaching. But the disciples also figure prominently in the narrative."

            "They had arrived at the stage where they recognised Jesus as the Christ. The second part of the Gospel of Mark, from 8:31 to the end, poses and answers the question: ‘Yes, but what kind of Christ?’ This latter half of the Gospel is devoted even more to the formation of disciples.",
            "As Jesus’ popularity with the people began to wane, because their expectations were not fulfilled, and as the political and religious opposition to him gathered pace, he progressively withdrew from the crowds and devoted more and more of his time and energy to the training of the Twelve. They were to be the nucleus, the core-group, the leaders, of the community he was in the process of creating.",
            "It was therefore of the utmost importance that they should come to have a deep understanding of who Jesus was, of his mission, and of what it would mean to them to be his followers. Having brought them to the point where they were able to acknowledge him as the Christ (however imperfect their understanding), Jesus now proceeds to enlighten them about how he must fulfil the mission entrusted to him by his Father.",
            "In particular, he impresses on them that the path which has been mapped out for him in God’s plan is the way of suffering and death. Only through suffering and death will he attain glory and resurrection. The latter part of Mark’s Gospel introduces the disciples into what is called the paschal mystery. They are told that there can be no knowledge of Christ apart from the cross, and no possibility of being his disciples unless they are prepared to accept the cross as he did.",
            "The section of Mark’s Gospel which runs from 8:31 to 10:45 is particularly instructive. It teaches that no-one can call himself or herself a disciple of Jesus, or his coworker in promoting God’s rule of justice and love, unless he or she shares with Jesus the desire to sacrifice self for the sake of others.",
            "This was a lesson which the disciples learned only with great difficulty. Three times Jesus predicted his approaching passion, death and resurrection (8:31; 9:31; 10:33-34), and on each occasion their reaction exposes their inability to comprehend this mystery. They rebuke him for even imagining such a thing, they argue among themselves about who is greatest, they request positions of honour in the kingdom.",
            "His patient response to their inability or unwillingness to understand is persistent and consistent: If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me (8:34); Whoever wants to be first must be last of all and servant of all (9:35); Whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all. For the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many (10:43-45)."

            "But John’s report of the Last Supper is invaluable for our consideration of how the disciples were to be the nucleus and core-group of the community he was creating to carry on his work. John’s account begins with Jesus performing the humbling task of washing his disciples’ feet. This was a teaching in action, impressing on them the need to humble themselves and put themselves at the service of others. He makes it quite explicit that they are to imitate his example.",
            "It is interesting to turn from Mark’s Gospel to John’s Gospel at this point. John is the only one of the four evangelists who does not describe the actual institution of the Eucharist, probably because he has already had so much to say about it when reporting Jesus’ ‘bread of life’ sermon back in Chapter 6. After feeding the 5000 people (John 6:1-15), Jesus explained to his disciples that he was the bread of life ... living bread that came down from heaven (John 6:48, 51). He went on to say that the bread that he was giving for the life of the world was his flesh, and that it was necessary to eat his flesh and drink his blood to have eternal life (6:48, 51, 53-54). Many of his followers were unable to accept this teaching and parted company with him. Jesus asked the Twelve whether they too wanted to leave. Peter, speaking on their behalf, said: Lord, to whom can we go? You have the words of eternal life (John 6:68).",
            "And so the story moves on to its climax. It is the time of the Passover, and Jesus makes preparations to have his final meal on earth with his disciples. At this Last Supper, the night before his death, Jesus instituted the Eucharist. Jesus took bread and wine and pronounced over them the words This is my body ... this is my blood, and, according to Paul (1 Corinthians 11:25) and Luke (22:19), added the command: Do this in remembrance of me. In this way, he anticipated, by the separation of his body and blood, the sacrifice he would make of himself on Calvary the following day. By inviting them to eat and drink, he brought them into an intimate participation or communion with his own sacrificial action and shared with them in advance its life-giving effects."

It seemed to the disciples that all their hopes and expectations for the establishment of the Kingdom perished on Calvary",
            "He tries to relieve their sadness at his impending departure. He even says it is better for them that he should go, because only then will the Paraclete, the Holy Spirit, come. The Greek word Paraclete suggests the role the Holy Spirit will play in their life and work. It suggests the ideas of advocate or counsellor, defender, comforter, and consoler. Jesus also refers to ‘the Spirit of Truth’, meaning that the Spirit will lead them into the fullness of truth, enabling them to penetrate more deeply all that they have experienced and learned from Jesus.",
            "He emphasises again and again the need for love of God and love of one another. He assures them of his continuing love for them, of which the gift of the Spirit is a pledge. In chapter 17, he prays to the Father for them, and asks for the gift of unity among them – that they should be one, even as Jesus and the Father are one. Only if they remain united in love will they be able to carry out the mission entrusted to them.",
            "Then follow three lengthy chapters (14-16) comprising Jesus’ farewell address to them, in which he impresses on them the things they need to absorb if they are to fulfil their allotted task. One is reminded of a tutor cramming his pupils before an examination, recalling all of the important lessons they would need to remember. And in a real sense their faith was to undergo a searching examination over the next few days, when they would see him die the shameful, degrading death of crucifixion, and would feel that their hopes were buried with him."

Jesus had said to them on the occasion of his leaving: not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for the promise of the Father. ‘This’, he said, ‘is what you have heard from me; for John baptised with water, but you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit ...’ (Acts 1:4-5).",

At first they could not bring themselves to believe the reports of the women, and indeed were all the more afraid. But that evening, he appeared to them, a fearful group huddled together for mutual support, and convinced them that he had indeed overcome death and was miraculously, gloriously alive.",
            "For forty days, he continued to appear to them at irregular intervals, strengthening their faith and giving them their final instructions. He tells them they must be his witnesses throughout the world. Matthew’s Gospel concludes with Jesus’ missionary mandate to the eleven disciples (Judas, of course, had defected): Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you (Matthew 28:19-20).",

Now on the very point of his final leave taking, he repeats the assurance that they are not being left alone, with the words I am with you always, to the end of the age (Matthew 28:20).",
            "Though reassured by Jesus’ resurrection from the dead and subsequent appearances to them, the disciples were still fearful that they might suffer the same fate as their master.

They suddenly became conscious of a great power possessing them: All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:4).",

They went out before the people, crowds of Jews from different countries, pilgrims who had gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the feast of Pentecost. Peter, the acknowledged leader of the disciples – now becoming apostles (ones who are ‘sent’) – proceeded to preach the first Christian sermon (Acts 2:14-41)."

It was this community which after his resurrection grew into the Church, and the Twelve became the foundation stones on which the Church was built.",

Instead, Luke attributes everything that happened in the young community to the Spirit. Every major step forward, every important decision that was made, every new direction that was taken – all is presented as the work of the Spirit. This is how Christ’s promise to his disciples in 1:8 was honoured.",

Stephen attacked the cherished belief of the Jews that the Temple was God’s dwelling place, and by implication he was critical of the law and the whole Jewish religious system. Stephen (a Greek name which means crown or garland and hence the symbol of martyrdom is often depicted as a laurel wreath) was stoned to death by the infuriated crowd, but the ideas that he voiced lived on. His version of the Gospel was one that was free of all narrowness, and so opened up the way to the reception of pagans or Gentiles into the Church."

This incident was seen by the author of Acts, as setting the precedent for the admission of Gentiles (non-Jews) into the Church. Cornelius may not have been the first Gentile to become a Christian, but Luke saw Peter’s involvement as a crucial factor.",

In Acts, the Spirit is more an external power, directing the growth of the Church through the activities of the apostles. But for Paul, the Spirit is more an interior principle of our spiritual life. Every believer is said to be a temple in which the Spirit dwells intimately, but the community as a whole is also called a temple where the Spirit resides.

This insight was probably imprinted on his mind at the time of his conversion, when he heard a voice from heaven calling: Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? When he asked the voice to identify itself, the reply came: I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. Paul who had been persecuting the Church realised that Jesus was identifying himself with his disciples (Acts 9:3-5).",

At Baptism, Christ through the Spirit incorporates all who believe in him into his risen body: For in the one Spirit we were all baptised into one body (1 Corinthians 12:13). Like Christ, the Christian undergoes a death and resurrection; we die to the old life of sin and rise to a new life (Romans 6:1-11). Our entry into the Body of Christ is sealed by the Eucharist. Through our sharing in the eucharistic bread, we are brought into communion with Christ and with one another: Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread (1 Corinthians 10:17). In this way all of us are members of his body (1 Corinthians 12:27), and individually we are members one of another (Romans 12:5).",
            "Paul first used the body of Christ image in an appeal to the Corinthians to heal the divisions which existed in their community. There was evidently some jealousy and resentment directed at those who possessed certain gifts, and patronising attitudes towards those who were less gifted. Paul develops the body image to stress the coresponsibility of members for one another. In Christ’s body there is a diversity of members and gifts and functions, but the one Spirit who gives to the different members different gifts for the overall welfare of the community (1 Corinthians 12:11). Unity in diversity is Paul’s principle.",

Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, in order to make her holy by cleansing her with the washing of water by the word, so as to present the church to himself in splendour, without a spot or wrinkle or anything of the kind – yes, so that she may be holy and without blemish (Ephesians 5:25-27). This idealised vision of the Church has its basis in the Old Testament where the love relationship between God and his people is also described in marriage, with God the bridegroom and Israel the bride. Paul transfers this image to Christ and the Church, and uses it to stress the fidelity and self sacrifice which is a feature of Christ’s love for his own.",
            "A more down to earth image of church is found in the so-called ‘pastoral letters’, the first and second letter to Timothy and the letter to Titus. It is now generally recognised that these letters were written not by Paul himself but by his disciples. They present a much more pragmatic picture of the Church. To ensure that the basic message of Jesus as taught by the apostles was preserved in its integrity, and not falsified or distorted by false teachers, the writer urged the careful selection and appointment of local church leaders and officials. It would be their primary duty to pass on the apostolic tradition as they had received it, and to protect it from all errors. We see here the beginnings of a structured church organisation with responsible leaders and officials."

            "All of these descriptions of the Church are important, and we should not ignore or neglect any one of them. The mystery of the Church is not able to be captured by any one image. But the description of the Church which the Fathers of the Second Vatican Council preferred was that of the people of God. The Council teaches that God’s will is to sanctify and to save people not as individuals without any bond or link between them, but rather to make them into a people who might acknowledge Him and serve Him in holiness (Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, no 9).",
            "It was for this purpose that God chose the Israelites to be his people and established a covenant with them. In God’s plan this was a preparation for the new and perfect covenant, foretold by the prophet Jeremiah (31:31-34) and sealed or ratified in the blood of Christ (1 Corinthians 11:25). The new covenant was with a new people of God made up of Jews and Gentiles – a people which would be one, not because they belonged to the same race, but because they were all baptised in the one Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:13). Those who believe in Christ are reborn from the seed of God’s word (1 Peter 1:23), and by water and the Holy Spirit (John 3:5-6).",
            "Another idea which appears in Paul’s letters is that of a group of people in exile, who journey in a foreign land apart from the Lord and their true home (2 Corinthians 5:6). They seek the things of heaven, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God, as they wait for the full revelation of Christ to take place (Colossians 3:1-4). This picture of a pilgrim people travelling towards the promised land comes through strongly in the first letter of Peter. This letter written from Rome to Gentile Christians in a remote part of the Empire, addresses them as ‘exiles.’ (1:1); They evidently felt isolated from the surrounding society and were ostracised by their pagan neighbours. The writer therefore reassures them of the new dignity they possess as God’s people, and reminds them that in the Church they have found a new home and a new family. Once you were not a people, but now you are God’s people, for you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people (1 Peter 2:9-10)."

        "Frequently, Simon acts as spokesman for the group. The most notable occasion is when Jesus asks them who they think he is. Simon speaks up on behalf of them all and says: You are the Messiah (Mark 8:29; Luke 9:20).",
        "According to Matthew, when Jesus asks his disciples who do you say that I am? Simon replies, You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God (Matthew 16:16). In response to this, Jesus pronounces him blessed, and changes his name to Peter, a word which meant ‘Rock.’ In the literature of the time and before, there is no evidence of the word ‘Peter’ having been used at all as a personal name. Previously it had been used only as a common word meaning rock or stone.",
        "The reason why Jesus bestows on Simon this new name is made clear in the following words. Jesus tells him that he is the rock, the foundation, on which the church is to be built, a church which will withstand the powers of evil (Matthew 16:17-19). After Jesus’ departure from this earth, Simon Peter was to be the centre of unity and stability within the community.",
        "It is Matthew’s version of this incident that is particularly significant. In the Gospel of Mark, Simon’s confession of faith in Jesus as the Christ, is followed immediately by an exchange between them which shows that his grasp of the mystery of Jesus was still quite inadequate. When Jesus explains that the way the Father has mapped out for him is the way of the cross, Simon reacts strongly against this, and is rebuked by Jesus even more strongly for his refusal to accept this (Mark 8:27-33).",
        "he Gospels tell us that Simon was one of the first called to follow Jesus. Mark, the earliest Gospel, tells us he received his vocation by the sea of Galilee, along with his brother Andrew, and another two brothers, James and John (Mark 1:16-20). He is always mentioned first in the lists of the twelve, even with the explicit mention of the word ‘first’ in Matthew 10:2."

He is to be seen more as the captain of a team.",

The image may imply that Peter was to be a guardian against false teaching, with authority to expel from the community those responsible."

            "The significant thing about both of these passages in Matthew and John is the note of delegated authority. By appointing Peter shepherd or pastor of the flock, Jesus assigns to him a role which elsewhere in the Bible is attributed to the God of Israel and to Christ. In Psalm 23 and in many other Old Testament passages, God is spoken of as shepherd, and, in John’s Gospel, Jesus describes himself as the good shepherd (John 10). Now Peter is called upon to exercise a similar function.",
            "Another key passage for understanding Simon Peter’s role in the early church occurs in John 21. This time the setting is after the resurrection of Jesus. On the occasion of Jesus’ arrest and trial, Peter had displayed weakness and cowardice in denying three times that he even knew Jesus (John 18:17, 25-27). Now the risen Christ invites him to make reparation for this triple denial. Three times he asks Peter, do you love me more than these? When Peter insistently declares his love, he is told that his duty and function is to feed Christ’s lambs and sheep, that is, to be shepherd or pastor to all who will come to believe in Jesus (John 21:15-17).",
            "Clearly this delegation of authority to Simon Peter, expressed in language with such a rich biblical background, shows that he was seen to hold a privileged position of responsibility in the life of the early Church.",
            "Like this commissioning of Peter as shepherd of the flock, so too, his identification as the rock has important biblical overtones. In Psalm 18 and elsewhere, God too, is called the rock on which the people of Israel is based. Paul, in his first letter to the Corinthians, identifies Christ as the rock. Now Simon, one of the twelve, is told he is to be the rock, on which the church will be built, so that the powers of death, i.e. the forces of evil, will not overcome it.",
            "Moreover, Peter is portrayed as the model shepherd or pastor of Christ’s flock, and his role and authority are based on his love for Jesus. As well as being a missionary group, the young Church would have to cope also with the problems of settled communities: local leadership, care of the faithful, watchfulness against dangerous innovations, in a word, pastoral concerns. It was Peter who was entrusted by Christ to oversee and provide for these needs.",
            "In this same connection, Peter is portrayed, in the first of the two letters which bear his name, as the one eminently qualified to instruct the presbyters or leaders of local churches on how to care for their flocks (1 Peter 5:1-11).",
            "It was because of his faith, that Peter was designated by Christ as the rock foundation on which the Church would be built, its centre of unity and stability. He was made the defender of the Church against the gates of Hades (Matthew 16:18), i.e. the powers of evil. He was given the keys of the Kingdom of heaven (Matthew 16:19), making him a guardian against false teaching. He was given the authority to bind and loose, that is, to make decisions for the welfare of the community."

We are told that Peter was favoured with an appearance of the risen Jesus, and according to one tradition, he was the first of the disciples to whom Jesus appeared after the resurrection. Paul quotes an ancient tradition to this effect in 1 Corinthians 15:5, and Luke confirms this in 24:34. Indeed, it was perhaps this tradition of the appearance of the risen Jesus to Peter first of all, which explains his prominence in the early Church, more than anything that happened during the ministry of Jesus. Given that in Jewish culture the women’s testimony counted for little, Peter was regarded as the first official witness of the resurrection.",

At this assembly, called to decide the question of whether Gentile converts should be obliged to live by the Jewish religious law, Peter speaks first, and his speech plays a major part in the decision which is reached, exempting Gentile Christians from the burden of that law.",

We have already seen in an earlier chapter how it was he who preached the first Christian sermon on the day of Pentecost, when 3000 people came forward and professed their faith. The Book of Acts, in chapter 10, reports at length how Peter was God’s instrument in converting the Roman centurion, Cornelius, to the faith, along with his household.",
            "No more is heard of Peter in Acts after this point, the rest of the book being mainly devoted to the activities of Paul, the great apostle to the Gentiles. In one of Paul’s own letters, to the Galatians, Paul reports a conflict at Antioch which he had with Peter for acting insincerely on the principle of relationships between Jewish and Gentile Christians (Galatians 2:11). Some would seek to find in this incident an argument against Peter’s authority in the Church. If anything, it proves the opposite. Paul claims that he was prepared to take issue even with Peter, rather than compromise on such an important matter."

Look what I was – and see what his grace has done for me.’ Peter wanted to show himself as the best possible advertisement for the power of the grace of God.",

The actual founding of the Church is non-repeatable; it took place once and for all. But the Church is always under construction, always in the process of being built up. It is surely reasonable to draw from the biblical passage the conclusion that implicit in Peter’s role there is the recognition of the need for one who will continue to be the rock, the basis and support of the Church. The words of Jesus surely apply to the preservation of the Church as well as its first foundation. The powers of evil (the gates of hell) referred to in Matthew 16:18 continue to assault the Church.",

In these letters, the mother of Jesus is mentioned only once, and even then not by name (Galatians 4:4). Similarly, the first Gospel to be written, the Gospel of Mark (c. 65 AD), begins with John the Baptist introducing Jesus to the people as an adult about to begin his public ministry.

            "A later passage in Mark (3:31-35) implies that Jesus dismissed his mother and members of his family, and instead nominated as his true family those who did the will of God. Mark’s Jesus seems to make a distinction between his blood relatives and those who accept him in faith.",
            "However, the later Gospels, especially the Gospels of Luke and John, present Mary as having a positive and prominent role in God’s plan of salvation. Obviously, the Holy Spirit guided later New Testament writers to an understanding of Mary and her role that went beyond what the earlier authors understood.",
            "Indeed if we had only the Gospel of Mark, we might well conclude that the mother and the family of Jesus were unsympathetic to his mission. Mark 3:21 tells us that Jesus’ family they went out to restrain him."

            "Thus the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, written about twenty years after the Gospel of Mark, include at the beginning of their accounts a description of events surrounding the conception, birth and childhood of Jesus. Naturally, Mary figures prominently in these infancy narratives (Matthew 1-2, Luke 1-2), especially in Luke’s version of events. Luke introduces Mary into his narrative in a passage (1:26-38) which describes the event commonly known as ‘The Annunciation’. In this story God reveals to Mary, through Gabriel, his angel or messenger, that he has chosen her to be the mother of his Son. Mary emerges from this account as a model for us of faith and of obedience to God’s will. These qualities are summed up in her sublime response to God’s message: Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word (Luke 1:38).",
            "At this point, in the light of what we said earlier about the low profile given to Mary in Mark’s Gospel, we note Luke’s version of Jesus’ response when he (Jesus) is told that his mother and ... brothers are standing outside wanting to see him (Luke 8:20-21). If we compare this passage with Mark 3:31-35, we see that according to Luke, Jesus makes no distinction between Jesus’ family and his true disciples. Mary is certainly included among those who hear the word of God and do it (Luke 8:21)."

            "Such fear and anxiety would surely have been felt by her in the incident described by Matthew in 2:13-15. Mary and Joseph had to take the child and make a hurried escape to Egypt, to avoid the murderous plans of King Herod who sought to destroy any potential rival. Again, Luke tells us that when Jesus was 12 years old, he was taken by Mary and Joseph to Jerusalem for the feast of the Passover. He became separated from them, and Luke tells us he was missing for three days. On finding him, in the temple, Mary in her anxiety complained: Child, why have you treated us like this? Look, your father and I have been searching for you in great anxiety. To which Jesus replied: Why were you searching for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house? Luke says they did not understand what he said to them, but Mary ... treasured all these things in her heart (2:48-51).",
            "When Mary and Joseph took the child Jesus to the temple of Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (Luke 2:22), they were met by a devout old man named Simeon who was inspired by the Holy Spirit to recognise the baby as the one who had been promised by God to Israel and who would be a light for revelation to the Gentiles (2:25-32). To Mary, Simeon addressed the words a sword will pierce your own soul too (2:35). This was a prophecy that Mary’s own faith would be challenged in a special way, and probably also contains a reference that she would experience anxiety and fear and sorrow as a result of the mission awaiting her Son.",
            "Her obedient response to the angel’s message in Luke 1:38 (let it be with me according to your word) depicts her as the first person in the Gospel story to hear the word of God and do it. She thus perfectly fulfils what Jesus describes as the mark of the true disciple. As well as being his mother, Mary was also his first disciple and the model of all true discipleship.",
            "Luke describes the birth of Jesus in most humble circumstances, in a stable, where he is visited by a group of shepherds who report what God has revealed to them about the new-born child: a Saviour, who is the Messiah (2:11). On hearing their testimony, Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart (2:19).",
            "Then follows Luke’s account of Mary’s visit to her relative Elizabeth, who had also received – along with her husband Zechariah – a revelation from God that she was to be the mother of the one who would be known as John the Baptist (1:39-56; cf 1:13). On this occasion Luke attributes to Mary a beautiful song of joy and praise of God, known (from its opening word in Latin) as the Magnificat. In this song, Mary acknowledges the great privilege God has given her: My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour, for he has looked with favour on the lowliness of his servant. Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed; for the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is his name (1:46-49)."

He does not mean that the time for performing miracles has not yet arrived, because he goes on to do just that. Jesus is thinking and acting on another level. While his mother was concerned about the scarcity of material wine, Jesus is thinking of the messianic wine – that is, the messianic age. More than once in the Scriptures, the messianic kingdom is described as a banquet feast, when wine will flow in abundance.",
            "Throughout his Gospel, John gives a special meaning to the word ‘hour.’ Jesus’ hour is the hour of his death and glorification. It was an hour determined by his Father and not able to be anticipated by men. On several occasions we are told that the Jews wanted to kill Jesus, but they could not, because his hour had not yet come. But as the end of his public life draws nearer, he realises that the hour has arrived. In 12:23, Jesus says: The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. In 13:1, John says that Jesus knew the hour had come for him to pass from this world to the Father. And he begins his beautiful prayer in chapter 17, recited on the eve of his death, with the words, Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you (17:1).",
            "Mary appears again on two significant occasions during Jesus’ public ministry, as reported in the Gospel of John. These incidents occur at the beginning and end of Jesus’ ministry. The first occasion was a wedding celebration in the town of Cana in Galilee, at which both Mary and Jesus were among the guests (2:1-11). The second occurs beneath the cross of the dying Jesus where Mary was present in the company of the one known in John’s Gospel as the disciple whom he loved (19:25-27). There are remarkable similarities between the Cana incident and the scene at the foot of the cross. Most significantly, on both occasions Jesus addresses his mother with the unusual title ‘woman’. The use of the word ‘woman’ to address one’s mother was certainly not the normal practice among the Jews at the time.",
            "It is also worth noting that John in his Gospel never refers to the mother of Jesus by her proper name ‘Mary’. At both Cana and the Cross, she is referred to simply as ‘the mother’ of Jesus. Taken together, these two facts suggest that John’s intention is to present her not simply as an individual. He is interested rather in her as in someone fulfilling a definite role or function.",
            "We see this clearly illustrated in the Gospel account of the wedding at Cana. In response to his mother’s quiet intervention, they have no wine, Jesus finally works a miracle and changes water into wine (John 2:3).",
            "We need to consider this incident at a deeper level. On this level, he rejects her intervention with words that appear at first sight brusque and sharp: Woman, what concern is that to you and to me?"

            "We need, therefore, to understand the Cana episode on two levels of meaning. On the material or lower level, Mary appeals to her son on behalf of the wedding guests, and he works a miracle. On a deeper or higher level, he rejects her intervention at this point. He is saying that he has his Father’s work to do, and disengages himself from the attachments of flesh and blood. We are reminded of his words to his mother as a boy of twelve, reported by Luke: Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house (2:49). An alternative translation is ‘Did you not know I must be about my Father’s business?’",

Jesus saw everything from the point of view of the mission entrusted to him by his Father. He interprets his mother’s intervention as a request for the messianic wine, a request he regards as premature.",
            "Implied in his reply is the idea that Mary is to have a limited or no role in his ministry, and in fact she is not mentioned again in John’s Gospel until the cross. It must also be noted that in this story, Mary ignored Jesus’ dismissive response and instead turned her attention to the servants. Despite the layers of meaning, there is still a hint of ordinary and simple family relationships at play.",

So too, the incident involving the mother of Jesus and the disciple whom he loved has to be seen as more than just a personal gesture on Jesus’ part. It is not just the dutiful act of a loving son, ensuring that his mother will be cared for, when he has gone. That is part of it, but the context suggests more than that was involved.",

Now, from the time of Jesus’ hour and exaltation, Mary too becomes the mother of all those who live the new life of faith.

At Baptism, we say to the newly-baptised: you have become a new creation. Put simply, this is what is at the heart of the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of Mary.",

We say in the Creed, I look forward to the resurrection of the dead. Put simply, this is what is at the heart of the doctrine of the Assumption. Both doctrines assert that the hopes of our faith have already been fulfilled in Mary. Mary is the model and pioneer of faith. Mary does not possess a different ‘kind’ of humanity from the rest of the human family.",

As various forms of Christian witness developed, the conviction that Mary remained always a virgin came to be held as Catholic doctrine. The Gospels leave undecided the question of the ‘brothers’ and ‘sisters’ of Jesus (Mark 6:3). Holding onto the idea of Mary’s virginity, the ancient Church fathers (early Christian writers) interpreted these passages in various ways. Some, for example, particularly in the East, suggested that Joseph married Mary as an elderly widower and already had children of his own. Others suggested that the terms ‘brothers’ and ‘sisters’ were best understood to mean ‘cousins’ and broader kindred, and it is this interpretation which has become the standard. By the 4th century, particularly through the writings of St Jerome, the Church had come to see Mary’s life-long virginity as part of her commitment to her Son and his mission.",

Her virginity appears at one and the same time as a sign of consecration and a sign of solitary powerlessness which gives glory to the fullness and power of God ... a sign of poverty, of humility, and of waiting upon God ... a sign of emptiness and total trust in God who makes rich such poor creatures as we are (Max Thurian, Mary, Mother of All Christians).",

            "It would be a mistake to see faith just in terms of an intellectual assent to truths or propositions put to us for our acceptance: I believe that God exists; I believe that Jesus Christ is truly God and truly human, that he rose from the dead, and so on. In every act of faith, our intellect certainly has a part to play, but there is more to faith than that.",
            "Our faith is the way we respond to God’s presence in our lives. As in the formation of every relationship, the response must be at every level of our being – mind, heart and will. It involves not only the acceptance of a creed, but a whole way of life, which implies love, commitment and permanence. It is a free and personal decision to surrender to God’s invitation. It is a fundamental conversion towards God, the ability to say ‘yes, I believe’ to what God teaches and asks of us, and to commit ourselves to live by God’s teaching."

            "Uncertainty and doubt may not disappear with the coming of faith, and they can coexist with faith. Faith is not knowledge that frees us from doubt but is a gift that makes it possible for us to live with doubt. Like Peter we are invited to risk walking on the waters, and even though like him we might seem to be sinking, our faith in God enables us to continue with confidence. It provides us with a certain direction, meaning and purpose to our lives.",
            "It is not God’s way to overwhelm us with ‘proofs’ that force us to believe. The resulting submission would no longer be faith. In love for us, God seeks to persuade, rather than compel, our assent. God wants our response to be free because real love cannot be forced. A compelled love is no love at all.",
            "There can indeed be times in one’s life when faith is at a low ebb. At such times, the importance of the support of other members of the believing community (family, friends, fellow Church members) becomes particularly apparent. For faith is not a purely private or personal response on the part of the individual to God. While a personal relationship with God or Christ is important, the faith of each person is part of the whole Church’s response to God’s self-revelation, that is, part of the faith of the Church. Just before the Sign of Peace at Mass, the priest prays on behalf of all: ... look not on our sins, but on the faith of your Church .... It is this faith, evidenced in the lives of so many believers past and present, that is our support in times of difficulty.",
            "In times of serious doubt, we should also be humble enough to seek guidance, both human and divine. Doubt need not be the enemy of faith, but the threshold to a more mature and authentic faith. We should remember the experience of so many believers throughout the centuries, beginning with Abraham, the great biblical model of faith, who put his hand into the hand of God and went out into the darkness. We have the assurance of so many of the saints of the Church that periods of great doubt and crises of faith (the so-called ‘dark night of the soul’) can lead to a new, more mature and realistic faith in God."

            "As is the case with every relationship, so too one’s faith can either grow or weaken. Our faith response to God’s self-revelation is not something final or static but is continually on the move, because God is present to us in an active way in our daily lives. Faith isn’t just about knowledge or information. Faith is primarily about relationship. Our faith is challenged and re-arranged through all the events of our life. We don’t have all the answers and we never will, but we can let our questions lead us to deeper truths. Faith must grow and develop; otherwise it will wither and even die. In other words, as we have said, faith is a dynamic relationship, a living encounter between God and self, whereby we grow continually in our understanding of God and God’s will for us, and commit ourselves to live by this.",
            "As time passes, and we reflect on our initial understanding of God and God’s will for us, our faith will gradually broaden and deepen. Teachings which may at first seem strange, difficult or even unimportant gradually come into focus and, even though some difficulties may remain, the pattern becomes easier and easier to grasp. If this process of growth is to take place, we must keep ourselves open to the Spirit of God whose task is to clarify the truth (John 14:26; 15:26; 16:13).",
            "However, the way faith comes to a person is a mysterious process. Prayer, study, meeting with other believing people and experiences of various kinds can all play a part in how each person is led to faith. However, when all is said and done faith is a free gift from God which cannot be earned. Others may assist in bringing someone to faith, but only God can give faith: For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God – not the result of works, so that no one may boast (Ephesians 2:8-9).",
            "Because it is a gift, and like every gift has to be freely accepted, faith can also be rejected. A relationship can never be forced on anyone. One person may reject faith, because what is proposed for belief seems untrue. Another may say ‘no’, because he/she sees the implications of faith and is unwilling to change a way of life. The journey to faith can be a painful process, since it may involve conversion of mind and heart and change of habits. Such radical conversion usually takes place only when there has been honest self-appraisal undertaken with courage over a period of time. It means putting aside established prejudices and being open to truth wherever it may lead. Obviously the process may not be an easy one. No birth is ever painless."

            "It may sometimes appear that ‘unbelievers’ show more faith by their exemplary lives and works of charity than some who profess to be Christian. By following their conscience they respond to God’s call even though they might be quite unaware of God or any call. It is true that not all works of charity or virtuous living are signs of faith, but they at least indicate a closeness to God that is only a step removed from faith. On the other hand, many believers show the weakness of their faith by their frequent failure in the area of love of neighbour.",
            "A measure of our growth in faith is the way we live. Towards the end of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus says: Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord’, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only one who does the will of my Father in heaven (Matthew 7:21). Discerning what is God’s will for us is a constant challenge. The Ten Commandments provide a basic rule of life; and the sermon on the mount represents a development of the old law, which Jesus said he had come to fulfil, or perfect, or complete. Above all his teaching was that the whole law could be summarised in terms of love.",
            "In conclusion, faith is the way we respond to God as God is revealed to us in our daily lives. It is a dynamic relationship, a living and continual encounter with God, whereby we grow continually in our knowledge of God and God’s will for us, and commit ourselves to live our lives accordingly. Faith is the basis of our life with God in this world. In the next life, it will give way to vision, when we shall see and know God face to face (1 Corinthians 13:12).",
            "A sign of the authenticity and depth of faith is that it flows over into a life of love, and is translated into good works. Paul speaks of faith working through love (Galatians 5:6). In 1 John 3:18, we read let us love, not in word or speech, but in truth and action. Our love should not be just words or talk, but must be sincere and show itself in action. James in his letter tells us that faith without works is also dead (James 2:26). This is his conclusion to an argument in which he asks what good is it for someone to say that he has faith if his actions do not prove it. Such faith will not save a person, James warns: If a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food, and one of you says to them, ‘Go in peace; keep warm and eat your fill’, and yet you do not supply their bodily needs, what is the good of that? So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead (James 2:14-17). Jesus’ dramatic description of the final judgement (Matthew 25:31-46) also reminds us that judgement rests on the performance or non-performance of good works.",

        "One of the distinguishing features of the Catholic Church is the importance which we attach to what we call the sacraments.",
        "By the thirteenth century, there was agreement about the number of sacraments (seven) which Catholics and Orthodox Christians recognise today. The Protestant reformers, taking the approach that only those sacraments should be retained which Jesus could be shown in the Scriptures to have clearly instituted opted for just two sacraments – Baptism and the Eucharist. But although it took time for the Church’s formal understanding of the sacraments to develop, the actual practice of the sacraments was part of Christian life and worship from the early centuries.",
        "The term ‘sacrament’ was used more widely in the early Church than it is today. In the first six centuries, Christian writers (especially those we call the Fathers of the Church) used the Latin word sacramentum (an oath that Roman soldiers took on entering the army) to describe various aspects of the nature and life of the Church, and especially Baptism. In the Middle Ages, the term ‘sacrament’ came to have a more precise meaning and it became necessary to determine which of the Church’s ancient practices fitted best the more precise definition of the term.",

            "Before proceeding any further, we need to recall what we have said in earlier chapters about God, Jesus Christ and the Church. This will enable us to situate the seven sacraments of the Church in their rightful context in God’s plan of salvation. This is a necessary step, because to consider the sacraments in isolation would inevitably lead to a distorted understanding of their place in Catholic belief and practice.",
            "What we have said earlier about the identity of Jesus of Nazareth shows the appropriateness of describing him as the sacrament or sign of God’s presence in the world. Many holy men and women in the history of Christianity like Francis of Assisi, Thérèse of Lisieux, Vincent de Paul, and Mary MacKillop have been true ‘signs’ of God’s presence in the sense that their virtues and life-style directed the thoughts and aspirations of people towards the God they served. The same can be said of people of our own time, like a Mother Teresa of Calcutta or a Pope John XXIII.",
            "But only Jesus can be fully the sacrament of God’s presence, the fully effective sign, because – uniquely – he is both God and human. In Matthew’s Gospel, he is called Emmanuel, which means God with us (1:23). Jesus himself, when asked by his disciple Phillip to show us the Father, replied, ‘Whoever has seen me has seen the Father’. (John 14:8-9). When the Word became flesh and lived among us (John 1:14) God began a new way of relating to human beings. In Jesus, God descended to our level to become accessible to our senses. Jesus is indeed the sacrament, the loving sign of God’s presence in the world.",
            "The sacraments are a prime example of God’s ‘incarnational’ way of approaching and relating to human beings. By this we mean that God chose to share the divine life with us not in an invisible or purely ‘spiritual’ way, but through persons, events and things that we can touch and experience through our senses. The Catholic Church teaches that the first and primary sacrament is Jesus Christ himself. God chose to save humanity and to communicate his life and grace by becoming a man who lived and walked among us."

            "In other words, Jesus used certain people as visible human channels of the same grace that was at work in him. It is our belief that he meant all his followers, the whole Church, to be a sacrament of God’s grace to the world – a means by which his grace and power would enter the world after his return to the Father. This is what is meant by calling the Church a sacrament of Christ.",
            "All of these instances are Jesus’ use of ‘signs’ or ‘symbols’ – specific persons, gestures and objects, which visibly symbolised and conferred God’s abundant grace and blessings. It is because Jesus himself established certain ways or ‘channels’ of sharing his life with people that the Church recognises a number of sacraments. Symbol and ritual are important elements in the Church’s celebration of the sacraments.",
            "The belief in the continuing presence of Christ with his Church meant much more to the early Christians than just the inspiration of his memory. St Paul, the first great interpreter of the person and work of Christ, understood this profoundly. In the book of the Acts of the Apostles, Luke, the author, in describing the sudden and dramatic conversion of Paul, says Paul heard a voice from heaven, asking: why do you persecute me? According to Luke, Paul up to this point had been a persecutor of the followers of Jesus. Now in his confusion, he asked: Who are you, Lord? And the reply he received was: I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting (Acts 9:4-5). Luke’s description of the circumstances of Paul’s conversion may explain the identification of Christ with the Church that we find in his letters. It was Paul who introduced the image of the Church as the body of Christ.",
            "Besides using persons to carry on his mission and communicate his grace, Jesus also employed specific actions and objects as visible signs of the life and blessing he came to give. Water was one such sign, as when Jesus was baptised by John and the Holy Spirit descended upon him (Mark 1:9-11). He used ordinary food to show the power of God. His first miracle in John’s Gospel was to change water into wine (John 2:1-11), and later he multiplied bread and fish to feed the hungry crowd (Mark 6:35-44; 8:19). By action and gesture, he communicated the grace and power of God. He often touched people when he healed them, even lepers (Mark 1:40-45), and used clay and spittle to open a blind man’s eyes (Mark 8:22-26). He breathed on his disciples to give them the Holy Spirit (John 20:22), and on the night before he died, he made use of bread and wine to give them his body and blood (Mark 14:22-25).",
            "It can also justly be said that the Church is the sacrament of Jesus Christ. We refer to what was said in an earlier chapter about Christ and the Church. Jesus of Nazareth lived on this earth for a relatively short span of time, and covered a very limited space of territory. Comparatively few people had the privilege of seeing or hearing or touching him in the flesh.",
            "Before he left the world to return to his Father, Jesus laid the groundwork for the continuation of the work he had begun. Matthew who began his Gospel by identifying Jesus as Emmanuel (God with us) concludes it with the promise of the risen Christ to his disciples: I am with you always, to the end of the age (Matthew 28:20).",
            "Out of such biblical insights came the view that the Church can be seen as the sacrament or effective sign of Christ’s continuing and permanent presence in the world. The bishops at the Second Vatican Council took up this understanding of the Church as a kind of sacrament of intimate union with God, and of the unity of all humankind.",
            "To call the Church a sign of Christ’s presence in the world may seem an extravagant claim to make, because members of the Church are far from perfect. John positively reminds us that those who say they have not sinned deceive themselves (see 1 John 1:8-10). Membership of the Church does not ensure sinlessness, but is a call to holiness and perfection (see Matthew 5:48) and to promoting and advancing God’s kingdom (see Matthew 6:10). By responding to this call, the members of the Church help to build up the Body of Christ so that it becomes more and more the sacrament of Christ in the world.",
            "During his lifetime on earth, Jesus himself established certain ways of sharing his life and power with humankind. We have reports in the Gospels of how Jesus sent out the Twelve and others of his followers (Luke mentions ‘seventy-two’ in his Gospel) and for their mission gave them a share in his own power and authority. He even promised his disciples: the one who believes in me will also do the works that I do and, in fact, will do greater works than these (John 14:12)."

The sacraments emerged as a distinctive part of the Church’s life as the apostles followed Jesus’ example and carried out his teaching. We shall see examples of this later.

It is present in a special way in those significant actions or signs of the Church which we call sacraments. Through them Christ makes a gift of himself in different ways, depending on the effect which each sacrament is intended to produce. Each sacrament has its own ‘sacramental grace’.",
            "When we say that Christ instituted the sacraments, therefore, we do not claim to have explicit biblical evidence that Jesus himself left to his Church a fully developed sacramental system.

In the same Constitution (no. 59), the Council summed up the purpose of the sacraments: The purpose of the sacraments is to sanctify people, to build up the body of Christ, and to give worship to God. Because they are signs, they also instruct. They not only presuppose faith, but they also nourish, strengthen and express it.",

In the versions of Paul (1 Corinthians 11:25) and Luke (22:19), after Jesus pronounced over the bread and wine the words This is my body ... this is my blood, he commanded his disciples Do this in remembrance of me. At every celebration of the Eucharist, the Church acts in obedience to this command of Christ.",

We celebrate welcome (Baptism), the acceptance of mission (Confirmation), the peace of forgiveness (Reconciliation), the joy of marriage, the response to a special vocation (Orders), the strength given the sick, and overall a share or communion with God’s own life (Eucharist).",
            "Also used in Baptism is oil, which is the principal element used in the sacraments of Confirmation, Anointing of the Sick and Holy Orders. Oil is an ancient biblical symbol used to convey the idea of God’s commissioning someone for a special function. Priests, prophets and kings of Israel were all anointed as signs of being commissioned by God for their particular tasks.",
            "It is important to appreciate the ‘appropriateness’ or the sign value of the symbols which the Church uses in the celebration of the sacraments. They are signs which were meaningful to people in ancient biblical times, but are also familiar to people of almost every nation and culture: washing with water, laying hands on a person’s head, sharing a meal, anointing with oil. In each sacrament the sign used teaches us something about the grace of the sacrament, the ‘sacramental grace’ or particular aspect of God’s loving initiative which is attached to each sacrament.",
            "Thus in Baptism, the Church uses water, which is richly symbolic. It suggests cleansing, satisfying thirst, but in a special way, life. Life cannot exist without water. It is the ideal element for the celebration of a sacrament which brings about a new birth into a new family of faith, and a sharing in the life of God."

The restored Catechumenate, or to give it its full title, Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults (RCIA) has been hailed as one of the most important results of the Second Vatican Council for the life of the Church. This is because it is designed to bring home to both catechumens and to ‘born and bred Christians’ the full implications of what it means to be born into Christ. It reminds all that the only possible way of approaching the Christian life is to see it as a process of total, lifelong, deepening ‘conversion’.",

            "All of these images contribute to express the wonderful effects produced in us by the sacrament of Baptism: grafted into Christ the vine; made a new creation; incorporated into the Body of Christ; conformed to the likeness of Christ; and entering into the life of the Trinity. Paul, whose imagery is so rich and diverse, also speaks of becoming a temple of the Holy Spirit, because it is by Baptism that the Spirit comes and makes a home in us.",
            "We become adopted children, sons and daughters, of the Father, given a share in the divine life. The newly baptised can now call God ‘Abba, Father’. Jesus Christ is their brother (see Romans 8:14-17), and all other baptised Christians are their brothers and sisters in Christ. The author of the first letter of John cried out in admiration: See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and that is what we are (1 John 3:1).",
            "The word ‘christening’ has been somewhat weakened and deprived of its force. Radically, though, it is a beautiful expression: ‘being christened’ means being made one with Christ, or con-formed to Christ. At Baptism, a person enters into the life of the Trinity, being baptised ‘in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit’. In the ancient Hebrew language, the word ‘name’ was practically synonymous with ‘person’, for one’s name conferred identity.",
            "The state of the baptised Christian is summed up by Paul in a phrase which could hardly be more simple but is so profound as to defy human understanding: we are ‘in Christ’. And this makes every other mark or identification tag (racial, social, or sexual) of quite secondary importance: As many of you as were baptised into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus (Galatians 3:27-28).",
            "We can use different images to describe what it means to be a baptised Christian. Paul spoke of being grafted onto the vine who is Christ, and thus empowered to bear fruit (Romans 11:17). The new Christian begins an entirely new life, is a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17), called to put aside the old self, and becomes a member of the Body of Christ. By Baptism, we become living members through which the life of the risen Christ flows and acts."

We have already seen Jesus’ reply to Nicodemus when Jesus said it was necessary to be ‘born again’, and Nicodemus (foolishly or facetiously?) asked if that meant he should enter his mother’s womb again. Jesus’ reply to this odd question was: no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit (John 3:5).",
            "The author of the letter to Titus, a disciple of Paul, also stresses the importance of Baptism: God saved us, not because of any works of righteousness that we had done, but according to his mercy, through the water of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit (Titus 3:5). This is a clear reference to Baptism.",
            "And the author of 1 Peter, a disciple of Peter, emphasises the same point: when God waited patiently in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight people, were saved through water. And baptism, which this prefigured, now saves you (1 Peter 3:20-21).",
            "It is on the basis of such texts of Scripture that Catholic Christians view Baptism as the first step in accepting God’s salvation. We also have the last words attributed to the risen Christ at the end of Matthew’s Gospel: Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19). Although on the evidence of the Acts of the Apostles, Baptism was first conferred in the name of Jesus, as a sign of union with the person of Jesus himself, by the time the Gospel of Matthew was written (50 years later), Baptism was into the name (person) of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.",

The water of Baptism retains the symbolic effect of washing and cleansing, the symbolic value of the Baptism practised by John the Baptist who saw the external washing as a symbol of an interior conversion. The primary symbolism however of the water of Baptism is that of new life brought about by a re-birth.",

Peter exhorted the crowd of Jews who had gathered: Repent, and be baptised every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ so that your sins may be forgiven; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38). There are several other passages in Acts which emphasise that in the early Church Baptism was seen as the first step in becoming a Christian (see also Acts 8:12-13; 8:36-38; 9:18; 10:47; 16:15; 19:5)."

            "Original sin is not an easy concept. We are not specifically searching for the ‘first’ sin (and therefore, the very first sinner) as if involved in a moral archaeological quest. Original Sin is best understood as a generic and universal human reality and condition of sin. The idea of ‘original sin’ comes to our attention firstly, not as a moment from human history but as a question about our everyday human experience. As we reflect on who we are, we come to the same realisation as Paul, For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do. Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells within me (Romans 7:19-20). As we think about who we are and how we live, we realise that, despite our best intentions, something goes awry. As much as we desire God, we do, in small and large ways, reject God’s goodness in our life. We only need to look at the world to realise that for all this world’s beauty and joy, there also lurks a terrible darkness and despair. Where does this come from?",
            "That is the question that the people of Israel attempted to answer in the Book of Genesis. The first eleven chapters of Genesis describe in story form the coming of sin into the world and its effects. It tells Israel’s version (with the help of ideas borrowed from other near-by cultures) of how, in the beginning of time, the human race became estranged from God by the deliberate sin of our first ancestors. As a consequence of their sin, alienation from God quickly multiplied so that the whole human environment became corrupted and contaminated. The world became alienated from God as a result of human sin. As a result, we are all born in the condition which is called ‘original sin’.",
            "However, this Infinite Love (God) which we can reject is infinitely greater than our lack. Baptism frees us from this sinful environment, as well as from personal sin in the case of adults, so that we can enjoy the freedom of the sons and daughters of God (Romans 8:18-25). This does not mean that the baptised are free from the influences of evil, but they are assured that they need no longer be enslaved by these influences because they can call on God’s power which is in them. Sin need no longer be their master.",
            "Conversion, turning away from sin, is a life-long process. Baptism is not a once-for-all completion of our union with God. Like every birth, it is a beginning, and needs to be lived out daily for the rest of our life. There are no ‘converts’, only people in the process of being converted.",
            "Although original sin is mentioned only once in the new baptismal rite, it remains a doctrine of the Church. It receives less attention only because the baptismal liturgy concentrates on the more positive aspect of new life.",
            "As well as mentioning the need for repentance, and the consequent forgiveness of sins, Peter in his first sermon also spoke of the baptised receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38). Paul developed this idea when he said for in the one Spirit we were all baptised into one body ... and we were all made to drink of one Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:13).",
            "Paul speaks of the whole of creation waiting for redemption (Romans 8:22). Everyone born into this sinful world is somehow touched and spoiled by the climate and the power of sin. Prior to any decisions we make as human beings, there is an inclination active within us to make choices away from what is ultimately good and true and beautiful. We live with the incapacity to fully embrace what is of God. We have a longing for God, for the Infinite, but we live in a world which requires finite choices. This necessity to make decisions and choices about who we are and how we live is hindered and mired by this incapacity to fully reach for the Love which calls to us. Our fear of finitude and death narrows our response to the Infinite. We turn away from Love and seek fulfilment in the ‘here and now’ and we frequently turn that which is positive in our lives into means of destruction. Respect can become envy, passion can become violence, desire can become obsession, pleasure can become addiction, and self-esteem can become self-centredness. History teaches us that human beings and human societies can swing wildly out of control and commit the most horrendous crimes and cruelties. There is no clearer example of ‘original sin’ than the damage that human beings have wreaked on one another in both spontaneous and calculated ways throughout the course of time."

            "Baptism is a participation in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is commonly administered by the pouring of water over the head of the candidate but the sign is most meaningful when the candidate is immersed in water, as was done in the early days of Christianity. The candidates were led down the steps of the baptismal pool, often in the shape of a tomb, and immersed or ‘buried’ beneath the surface of the water. They were then raised up, and led up the steps on the other side of the pool – to share the life of the risen Christ.",
            "Baptism is thus seen as a sign of dying and rising with Jesus himself. With him we are raised to new life: we already begin to live the risen life. When Paul wrote, I have been crucified with Christ, he was thinking not only of the physical suffering he had to endure for Christ’s sake, but of his death to his old self, and to all the values and attitudes of that former existence which were not Christ-minded. And so he would exclaim in joy and wonder: it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me (Galatians 2:20).",
            "Paul also compared Baptism to being buried with Christ, a burial that results in death to sin and the ‘old nature’, resurrection to life with God, and putting on a completely new nature. He wrote: Do you not know that all of us who have been baptised into Christ Jesus were baptised into his death? Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life ... The death he died, he died to sin, once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus (Romans 6:3-4, 10-11)."

Immediately after Peter urges his listeners to be baptised (Acts 2:38), he adds the words: For the promise is for you, for your children, and for all who are far away, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to him (2:39). The New Testament also speaks on several occasions of the baptisms of whole households, which in normal circumstances would include children.",
            "The Catholic Church, like all the mainline Christian churches, understands Baptism as an action of Christ welcoming a new member into his family. At that moment, it is true that the one being welcomed is too young to take a conscious part in the proceedings, but nevertheless Baptism marks the beginning of the life-long process of conversion. The coming to faith and the growth in faith which accompanies conversion are a gradual on-going process. The presentation of an infant for Baptism should presuppose the kind of environment in which the child will receive the education and example that will lead him or her to become more aware of the value of God’s gifts and of Christ’s call to follow him.",
            "In Christian countries the great majority of candidates for Baptism continue to be infants. While infants have no need to have personal sins forgiven and are not able to offer a personal response of faith, the practice of infant Baptism is a recognition of Jesus’ particular nearness to children. It also emerges from the wisdom of the Church that recognises that families (and the Church) are enriched when faith is a tangible feature of the earliest memories and experiences of childhood. However, there are some Christian communities which demand that Baptism be deferred until the person is able to make his or her own decision for Christ. For this reason, infant Baptism is not universally practised among Christians today.",
            "It has been convincingly argued that the attitude of Jesus to the children who were brought to him for his blessing was probably preserved as part of an early Christian liturgy for the Baptism of infants and children.",

But when Jesus saw this, he was indignant and said to them, ‘Let the little children come to me; do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs. Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it.’ And he took them up in his arms, laid his hands on them, and blessed them. (Mark 10:13-16)"

This will prepare the child to make a personal commitment to Jesus Christ upon reaching maturity. Such a personal faith commitment is absolutely necessary for the mature Christian. One way the Church stresses the necessity for this commitment to the Lord is by calling on each person to renew his or her baptismal covenant every year at the Easter Liturgy.",
            "Infant Baptism also underscores the fact that salvation is a free gift from God. When someone baptises, it is Christ who baptises. He is the one who saves. Infant Baptism reminds us that this salvation through baptism is not something the person could have earned or merited. It reminds us that the sacraments are primarily works of God, and that God’s initiative in our lives is most important. The infant did not choose to be baptised, but neither did he or she choose to be born. Both birth and Baptism are God’s gift, brought about through human agents: the children’s parents. Just as the parents cooperate in God’s plan by initiating their child’s physical life, they can also cooperate with God, through their faith, in initiating the child’s eternal, spiritual life by presenting the child to be baptised.",
            "The Rite of Baptism makes clear where the opportunities and responsibilities lie. There is a sense in which the whole local church community has a part to play in bringing the child to God. Within the community, of course, it is the child’s parents and godparents who are specially called to share their faith with the child and to do all they can to encourage and support the child’s growth in faith. Parents and godparents are required to renew their own baptismal promises. They profess their belief and commit themselves to being living examples of faith and leading their child into the mystery and wonder of God. It is through this relationship that one day a child might come to voice his or her own faith.",
            "In the Gospels, there are a number of examples of Jesus responding to the faith of parents when petitioning on behalf of their children. When Jairus, the synagogue leader, asked Jesus to raise his young daughter from death to life (Mark 5:22-23, 35-43), and when another father asked Jesus to expel an evil spirit from his son (Mark 9:17-27), Jesus acted with power because of their faith, not the faith of their children.",

There are three sacraments whereby a person is fully initiated into the Body of Christ; Baptism, Confirmation and Eucharist. The new Christian celebrates all three of these sacraments with the community at the Easter Vigil. This was the standard practice in the early centuries of Christianity. But in the Western Church, when entire communities had become Christian, and infant Baptism became the norm, it became the practice to delay Confirmation until the child was older. Both Confirmation and Eucharist became separate events to be celebrated later on, when the child had reached the so-called ‘age of reason’. It is interesting to note that in the Eastern Orthodox churches, infants are still confirmed and given the Eucharist on the occasion of their Baptism."

Christians often received the full outpouring of the Holy Spirit through the prayer and ‘laying on of hands’ of the apostles or their associates. Later an anointing with oil was added to the sacrament, and this is how the sacrament of Confirmation originated. The commitment to Christ was thus ‘confirmed’ or strengthened in the life of the baptised Christian.",

Just as Scripture draws a close connection between the resurrection of Jesus and the sending of the Spirit, so too the sacrament of Confirmation receives its proper emphasis when it is seen in close association with the sacrament of Baptism. The book of the Acts of the Apostles is really a record of the activity of the Holy Spirit from Pentecost on, guiding and directing the growth of the Church in its early years. The sacrament of Confirmation makes Pentecost a permanent event in the life of the Christian.",

Some theologians think the reason why these people lacked the Holy Spirit was because they were initially baptised only in the name of Jesus, and not in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19).",

The Holy Spirit comes first to a person in Baptism (see Acts 2:38), but the book of Acts also mentions a prayer for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit accompanied by the external, visible sign of a ‘laying on of hands’. Later we read that Peter and John were sent to new converts in Samaria and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit (for as yet the Spirit had not come upon any of them; they had only been baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus). Then Peter and John laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit (Acts 8:15-17)."

The candidate renews his or her baptismal promises, and the bishop (or delegated priest) anoints the candidate on the forehead with fragrant Chrism (consecrated) oil, saying the words: Be sealed with the gift of the Holy Spirit. To be ‘sealed’ means to be authoritatively marked or stamped as someone’s property. The oil is the sign of the strength which the sacrament gives. The ‘gift of the Holy Spirit’, a share in God’s life and love, is of course a single gift, but it will manifest itself in a multitude of ways. A traditional list of ‘gifts’ of the Spirit is taken from the prophecy of Isaiah (11:2-3), where the prophet numbers seven gifts. It should be remembered that the number seven in biblical symbolism stands for fullness, completeness and perfection. In the rite of Confirmation the bishop or his delegate prays that the candidates should receive the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and fortitude, the spirit of knowledge and piety; ... [and] the spirit of the fear of the Lord."

But these sacraments also assure us that we are never alone on our pilgrimage, and that God – Father, Son and Holy Spirit – is our constant companion. The whole of Christian life is not captured in singular sacramental moments but experienced and expressed throughout the life-long journey of deepening of our relationship with Jesus. Real Christian initiation continues throughout all the days of our life."

The Second Vatican Council described it as both the ‘summit’ and the ‘fountain’ of the whole of the Church’s life and activity. In describing the Eucharist as the ‘summit’ of the Church’s activity, the Council wanted to express primarily the Church’s belief that the Eucharist is the highest form of worship we can offer to God.",

Sad to say there are those who worship God out of a sense of fear. ‘Fear of the Lord’ has its place in a person’s religious outlook, but it should never be the main motivation for worship. Others approach their worship in the spirit of paying a debt, and act out of a sense of obligation to God because of God’s gifts to them. This represents a definite advance on the fear motivation, but love must be the dominant attitude behind one’s desire to give thanks, not just a sense of duty. We should want to worship God because we want to respond to the great love shown for us, by expressing our love for God in the best possible way."

Other versions are found in the first three Gospels (Mark 14:22-25; Matthew 26:26-29; Luke 22:14-20). Although there are slight variations in the different accounts of Jesus’ words, they are not significant. Luke describes it this way: Then he took a loaf of bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, ‘This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.’ And he did the same with the cup after supper, saying, ‘This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood’ (22:19-20).",

In each of the Gospel accounts there is a variation of a saying of Jesus which suggests that in the very beginning, what Jesus did was seen as an anticipation of the coming of the kingdom. The earliest Gospel, Mark, reports that immediately after speaking of his blood of the new covenant which was poured out for many, Jesus said to his disciples: Truly I tell you, I will never again drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God (Mark 14:25; see also Matthew 26:29 and Luke 22:15-16)."

            "The word Eucharist was probably not used in the early days of Christianity. The book of Acts tells us that in the earliest period Jesus’ followers in Jerusalem would meet in one another’s homes, where: They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers (Acts 2:42). The phrase breaking bread in their homes recurs in verse 46. Although this expression can mean simply ‘sharing a meal’, it seems certain that on some occasions at least, they included in their common meals a re-enactment of the words and actions of Jesus at the Last Supper. It is commonly thought that the phrase ‘the breaking of bread’ was an early Christian name for the Eucharist. It was also known as ‘the Lord’s Supper’, as we learn from Paul (1 Corinthians 11:20).",
            "The coming reign of God’s love was on several occasions described by the Old Testament prophets in the imagery of a banquet, and wine was used as a symbol of the blessings which would flow in the messianic age. Paul also uses a phrase which connects the Eucharist with the return of Christ: For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes (1 Corinthians 11:26).",
            "There is widespread evidence in the New Testament to indicate that the Christians of the first generation believed that Jesus would soon come again to establish the kingdom or reign of God in its perfect and complete form. It is quite understandable then that they would have seen the words and actions of Jesus at the Last Supper as the anticipation and pledge of the coming kingdom."

By his words Do this in remembrance of me (Luke 22:19), he offered to the first disciples and to all who would come after them the gift of sharing continually in this new memorial and of belonging to a new covenant with God, of which the blood of Jesus was the sign. (The Greek phrase translated as in remembrance of is eis anamnēsin. A slightly more accurate translation is: do this as a memorial of me. In the context of the Passover meal it has a significance that is both past, present and future – God’s covenant then, now and forever.)",

In a spirit of love and gratitude, they remembered God’s many gifts and constant love throughout their history. At this Passover feast, they re-enacted in a prayerful way a living memorial of an event that had happened in past history, but whose blessings they still experienced in the present. Their celebration took place in the setting of a sacred meal, during which they ate from a lamb which had been sacrificed to God in the temple the previous afternoon. They sang psalms of praise to God for the gift of the Passover from slavery to the freedom of the promised land, and for the covenant which this loving God had made with them as God’s own people.",
            "Both Paul and Luke in their versions of the Last Supper note that Jesus added the words Do this in remembrance of me. This indicates that as well as understanding the Eucharist as an anticipation of the kingdom, the first followers of Jesus also emphasised the memorial aspect of the Lord’s Supper which they celebrated. To understand this fully, we need to reflect on the context in which Jesus instituted the Eucharist, especially the fact that he did so in the setting of the Jewish Passover meal."

            "From the idea of memorial, it was a natural progression for the early Christians to come to an understanding of the Eucharist as a sacrifice. The connection between what Jesus said and did at the Last Supper and the sacrifice he made of himself the following afternoon was clear. After all, did he not speak of the bread as his body which was given for them, and of the wine as his blood which was poured out for them? The Eucharist was thus seen as the memorial of Jesus’ death. Paul said that eating the bread and drinking the cup were a proclamation of the Lord’s death. Earlier in the same letter (1 Corinthians 5:7) he had said our paschal lamb, Christ, has been sacrificed. The followers of Jesus thus came to see that Jesus offered himself as the new lamb of sacrifice, and commanded them to do this in memory of him.",
            "In line, therefore, with the Jewish understanding of the words ‘memory’ and ‘memorial’ we believe that Jesus did not just demand a simple recall of what he had done but a re-enactment. Just as he changed bread and wine into his Body and Blood, the Church believes that the disciples were empowered by him to do the same. Moreover it is Catholic belief that this power continues to reside in the Church, and that part of the spiritual power of the Church gathered at Eucharist is to call on the Holy Spirit to change the gifts of bread and the wine (along with ourselves) into the Body and Blood of Christ.",
            "For this reason, the Catholic tradition of Christianity has always insisted that the words of Jesus, This is my body ... this is my blood, must be understood not just in a figurative sense (‘this signifies ...’) but in the sense that the bread and wine really become the Body and Blood of Christ in a sacramental way. This realistic understanding of Jesus’ words is confirmed by the famous sixth chapter of John’s Gospel, the last Gospel to be written, in the last decade of the first century.",
            "John chose not to describe the institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper, but gives a lengthy report of a discourse of Jesus after he had fed the 5,000 people with a few loaves and fishes. Jesus’ words as reported by John clearly show that John’s community at least firmly believed that the eucharistic bread and wine were truly the Body and Blood of Jesus."

We continually look for tangible signs of God, and although the whole of creation speaks of God’s presence, in this sacrament the search is on its way to completion, because the Eucharist is a real communion with God.",
            "It also becomes clear in John’s account that Jesus’ teaching was a cause of scandal to the Jews and to others who were considering becoming his followers – perhaps even to other Jewish Christians of John’s time (late first century) who were unable to accept this exalted understanding of the Eucharist. According to John, Jesus spoke of the need to eat his flesh and drink his blood to gain eternal life (John 6:53-56), and predicted that many people would be scandalised and fall away from following him because of his teaching (6:60-64). This teaching is as much of a challenge to the faith of Christians today as it was to the readers of John’s Gospel then.",
            "Catholic Christians accept this challenging teaching at its face value, and believe that when they receive the bread and wine of the Eucharist, they are actually partaking in the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. This always, of course, needs careful nuance to preserve the sacramental meaning behind the Church’s understanding.",
            "The ‘real presence’ of Jesus Christ in the bread and wine of the Eucharist is an important part of the Catholic tradition. It is also a central belief in the Eastern Orthodox churches, as well as the Anglican and Lutheran traditions.",
            "In an ecumenical statement between the Catholic and Anglican churches, both traditions were able to hold this consensus: What is here affirmed is a sacramental presence in which God uses the realities of this world to convey the realities of the new creation: bread for this life becomes the bread of eternal life. Before the Eucharistic Prayer, to the question: ‘What is that?’, the believer answers: ‘It is bread’. After the Eucharistic Prayer, to the same question he answers: ‘It is truly the body of Christ, the Bread of Life’ ... The bread and wine become the sacramental body and blood of Christ in order that the Christian community may become more truly what it already is, the body of Christ.",
            "This presence of Jesus can be accepted only in faith, since the outward appearance of the bread and wine does not change. Medieval Catholic theologians used the term ‘transubstantiation’ to describe the mystery that the inner reality (substance) of the bread and wine is transformed into the Body and Blood of Christ, while the outward appearance remains the same. This doctrine is not intended to explain how it happens, or to reduce this mystery of faith to magic. It simply affirms in faith that Jesus’ words are literally true: the bread and wine offered to God in the Eucharist become his Body and Blood.",
            "This is why Catholics have great reverence for the eucharistic bread and wine. They do not worship ‘the host’ (the name given to the eucharistic bread), but worship Jesus Christ whom they discern by faith to be present there. Of course a ‘real sacramental’ presence must be distinguished from a ‘real physical’ presence. Christ is present truly but not ‘physically’ in the same way that a human being is present. Christ’s presence is mediated through sacramental symbols such as bread and wine.",
            "It is also important to remember that the Church teaches that in the Eucharistic gathering, Christ is present in four ways: in the gathered assembly, in the priest (who is Christ’s representative), in the word (the Scripture that is proclaimed), and most profoundly, in the Eucharistic elements of bread broken and wine poured out and shared. Properly understood, the real presence of Jesus Christ is not a scientific fact or philosophical position to be proven, but a real ‘person’ to be encountered.",
            "This understanding is also affirmed by Paul who wrote in 1 Corinthians: The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a sharing in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread (1 Corinthians 10:16-17). Further on in this letter, after describing Jesus’ words and actions at the Last Supper, Paul concludes: Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be answerable for the body and blood of the Lord (1 Corinthians 11:27). The most straightforward interpretation of these passages is that Paul considered the eucharistic bread and wine to be really the body and blood of Christ."

Paul reminds the Corinthians of the love and sharing that should take place when they meet for a meal (1 Corinthians 11:33), but especially for the Meal, the Lord’s Supper (1 Corinthians 11:18-22). Luke tells us how the two disciples recognised Jesus after his resurrection at a meal, at the breaking of the bread (Luke 24:30-31, 35). Our eucharistic celebration is also in the form of a meal. We prepare bread and wine and share that bread and wine among ourselves when it has become the Body and Blood of Christ."

However, the Church has never taught that Jesus is ‘re-sacrificed’ or offered up to suffer again. We call the Eucharist a sacrifice because we see it as ‘re-presenting’, i.e. presenting once again before us, the one sacrifice of Christ on Calvary.",

The full sacrifice of Jesus Christ is his self-giving to the Father for us which was made manifest in his birth, his life, his preaching, his miracles, his acts of love and justice which found their climactic expression in his death, resurrection and sending of the Spirit. The sacrifice of Christ is the total pouring out of his life for us. It is Jesus Christ’s gift of himself in response to the love of his Father. In the Holy Spirit, we too are drawn into this gift of life and love (sacrifice). We begin to ‘taste’ now the life of the Trinity. This gives us a ‘window’ or ‘fore-taste’ into the day when we will hopefully fully share in the ‘heavenly banquet’. Sacrifice in a Christian sense is not only an ‘emptying’, a ‘foregoing’, but also a ‘gifting’, a ‘birthing’ of new life.",
            "Sacrifice is difficult terminology, particularly when we believe in a God of love and mercy. Sacrifice in the ordinary sense of the word tends to be understood as a ‘letting go’ or a ‘foregoing’ of time or money or what is rightly and fairly due. In a religious sense, it can be understood as a gesture or act to persuade or appease a divine being. However, a Christian sense of sacrifice has a much fuller and richer meaning.",
            "This once-and-for-all sacrifice of Christ is most clearly fulfilled on Calvary but this cannot be separated from the whole of Jesus’ earthly life. To say that Eucharist is a sacrifice is to say that in the Eucharistic celebration we encounter this self-giving of Jesus Christ. In God’s mercy, this same once-and-for-all sacrifice of Christ is made present to us through the Eucharist and we, the faithful, are made present to this gift of self-offering. The full meaning of the ‘sacrifice of the Mass’ can be seen in the words of the Third Eucharistic Prayer:",
            "In the Eucharist, we call to mind, not only Jesus’ death, but also his resurrection, ascension and our expectation of his coming again. We ask God to look upon our prayer and gathering and ask the Father to ‘see’ and ‘recognise’ in our offering, his Son. Drawn into this relationship of Father and Son, we then ask that we may be even more deeply-filled with the Holy Spirit so that we might become ever-closer to Christ. The sacrifice of Jesus Christ changes us and brings us to new life. That is the ‘redemptive’ meaning and purpose of the sacrifice of Jesus. Our small and large efforts to live in love, justice and service are our participation in the loving sacrifice of Christ. Sacrificial love brings life to all relationships, and there is no better model of sacrificial love than the life, death and resurrection of Jesus."

It was generally assumed that all Christians who were physically able would gather on this day to worship the Lord and partake of his body and blood. In the letter to the Hebrews (10:25), there is a warning against not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some. The Church follows this practice of requiring its members to worship together on Sunday as a community and to praise God for all the gifts that have flowed from the Son’s death and resurrection.",
        "Writing a few decades after St Ignatius, St Justin Martyr provides a description of these early church celebrations: On the day called Sunday there is a meeting in one place of those who live in cities or the country, and the memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read as long as time permits (Liturgy of the Word). When the reader has finished, the president in a discourse urges and invites us to the imitation of these noble things (homily). Then we all stand up together and offer prayers (intercessions). And when we have finished the prayer, bread is brought, and the wine and water, and the president similarly sends up prayers and thanksgivings to the best of his ability, and the congregation assents, saying Amen (Liturgy of the Eucharist); the distribution and reception of the consecrated elements by each one takes place (Communion) and they are sent to the absent by the deacons (Dismissal). We can see that the basic liturgical pattern remains the same today.",
        "It is not clear from the Bible who presided over the Eucharist or Lord’s Supper in the first century, but in the early second century St Ignatius of Antioch stated that only the bishop or his appointed representatives could lead the community in the celebration of the Eucharist. This became the accepted pattern: bishops were the primary leaders of the official worship of the Christian community, and they appointed priests to assist them when their ‘flocks’ became too large for one man’s sacramental ministry. Today the Church carries on this ancient practice of having only bishops and the priests they appoint preside over the Eucharist. This is part of the doctrine of ‘apostolic succession’, which states that the bishops are the ones who succeed to the ministry and leadership of the apostles, to whom Jesus gave the direct commission: ‘Do this in memory of me’."

Although no one is without sin and the Eucharist itself is a channel of God’s forgiveness, a person whose life is a contradiction of the gospel (i.e. in a state of mortal sin) may not receive the sacrament without first being reconciled through the sacrament of Penance, which we will consider in the next chapter. For lesser sins, the penitential act, if entered into in the spirit of conversion, serves to enable us to be ready."

Catholics should earnestly wish to seek reconciliation with other Christians, both as Churches and individuals, so that we will be able to approach the altar of God together in genuine unity of mind and heart. Until the day when the Lord heals the present disunity, the pain of the divisions that prevent Catholics from sharing the Lord’s Supper with other Christians serves as a strong motivation for us to pray and work (in ecumenical endeavours) for the unity of God’s people.",
            "Moreover, only those who are members of the Catholic Church are allowed to receive Communion, although there are some exceptions to the general rule. The Eucharist is meant to be a visible sign of the unity of God’s people in Jesus Christ. Paul stresses this aspect of the Eucharist in the passage from 1 Corinthians already quoted where he speaks of all who are one body participating in the Body of Christ.",
            "The sad reality is that the Body of Christ today is not one, but is divided into many churches and communities who disagree on many important issues. One of those divisive issues is whether the bread and wine offered at the Eucharist really becomes the body and blood of Christ. Christians also disagree about who has the proper authority to preside at the Eucharistic celebration.",
            "The Catholic Church considers these disagreements and divisions so serious that except in special circumstances, it does not permit its members to receive communion in other Christian churches, nor allow other Christians to receive the Eucharist in the Catholic Church until these differences are resolved. Catholics believe that in the Eucharist they are truly receiving the body and blood of Jesus Christ, and that their reception of the Eucharist expresses their communion or unity with the whole Church. They also believe that only their bishops and the priests they ordain have the authority, stemming from Jesus’ commissioning of his disciples at the Last Supper, to preside over the Eucharistic celebration.",
            "The Church has decreed that its members cannot in good conscience join with other Christians in this ‘sacrament of unity’, while there remains a basic disunity and disagreement with them about the Eucharist itself and other important points of Christian faith. It is the Church’s view that participation in the Eucharist is primarily the ultimate sign of the unity that exists among Christians rather than a means for achieving unity. We realise other Christians do not share this perspective, but we ask them to respect this understanding of intercommunion when they attend a Catholic service, just as we should respect the beliefs of those who have a different point of view.",
            "There are other Church regulations to the effect that a person should fast from food and drink (excluding water and medications/medicine) for one hour before receiving Holy Communion. This rule aims to promote greater respect for the Eucharist. Moreover, it is a law of the Church that a Catholic must receive Communion at least once during the Easter season each year. Such an obligation is of course completely unnecessary for those who appreciate the value and privilege of celebrating the reception of Christ in the Eucharist. It is a relic of the times when, because of a misguided respect (people thought they were not worthy), people received the Eucharist very rarely."

For this reason they regard the Eucharist chapel (i.e. Blessed Sacrament Chapel), or tabernacle, as a sacred place.

        "An anxiety which is often expressed by critics of modern religious education and of contemporary preaching is that not enough attention is paid to the reality of sin. It is as though ‘nothing seems to be a sin anymore’.",
        "For sin certainly does exist. It’s a reality which causes us to become estranged and alienated from God. It is in fact much more prevalent than most people are aware of. If we see sin only in terms of actions done in violation of particular laws, we can fail to recognise many omissions, failures to act, attitudes and prejudices which fall into the category of sin. Particular actions can be, and often are, sinful, but sin is primarily a matter of values and attitudes. Jesus himself, in the Sermon on the Mount and elsewhere, emphasised internal dispositions. Sinful actions are the external expression of the sinful condition which resides in a person’s heart.",
        "If the whole law of God, all the commandments, depends on this double commandment of love – love of God and of neighbour – then it follows that sin is basically a lack of love. Just as love expresses itself in many ways, by the observance of the particular commandments of God, so sin is displayed in many forms, by the violation of specific commandments. But ultimately sin consists in the refusal or failure to love God and one’s neighbour. With this view of sin, our actions are sinful when they flow from an unloving heart.",
        "When Jesus was asked to nominate the most important of the commandments, he did not single out any one of the ten but replied: ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the greatest and first commandment. And a second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbour as yourself.’ On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets (Matthew 22:37-40).",
        "The complaint is heard that so much emphasis is placed on God’s love and forgiveness that the gravity of sin tends to be played down. If God is so loving and forgiving, does it really matter how we behave? This argument reflects a misunderstanding of the nature of the relationship between God and ourselves. Certainly we must trust in God’s forgiveness, but we must not presume on it or take it for granted."

When we are truly sorry for our sins and turn to God, we become aware of God’s love and know that we are forgiven.",
            "One of the most beautiful experiences we can have is that of being forgiven. The way to forgiveness can be hard and even painful, but it is worth it all to know that despite our faults we are still loved. Forgiveness is the reassurance that those we have offended still love us.",
            "It does not have to mean that the past is forgotten or that the wrong we have done no longer matters. Our past sins are all part of the tapestry of who we are, but forgiveness makes it possible for us to weave them all into this tapestry without fear, so that we can be at peace again with ourselves, our fellow men and women, and our God. That is the meaning of reconciliation.",

Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you (Isaiah 49:15). God promises the people never to forget them, and reminds them that God loves them as a good and loving parent and has always led them with cords of human kindness, with bands of love (Hosea 11:4). Return to the Lord, your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love, and relents from punishing (Joel 2:13)."

To the paralysed man who was brought to him, he said Your sins are forgiven ... Stand up and take your mat and walk.

When he was accused of associating with sinners, he addressed to his critics the parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the lost (or ‘prodigal’) son (Luke 15:1-32). These stories make the point that God takes delight in forgiving, and is always ready to extend a warm welcome home to one who has strayed.",

When the son attempted to make his prepared speech about how badly he had behaved, his father interrupted him and told everyone to get ready for a feast, for this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found (Luke 15:24).",

That is why it is so important to be aware of God’s attitude to those who have sinned, and to realise that the road back to God is always open. The road to be taken is the same as in Christ’s day: he is the way to the Father; he is still the one who heals and forgives; his work continues through the Church.",

The Church is founded on the belief that Jesus passed on this authority to his leading disciples so that they could continue his ministry and mission after his departure. He gave them the Holy Spirit as the source of their authority to forgive sins in his name. It is true that Jesus commanded all of his followers to forgive one another (Matthew 6:14; 18:21-23; Luke 17:3-4), but Jesus also gave his leading disciples a special authority to ‘bind and loose’, and to forgive sins in God’s name.",

There is evidence to show that Jesus intended that his closest disciples, the Twelve, should have the same authority to forgive sins as he had himself. To Peter, the leader of the Twelve, Jesus said: whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven (Matthew 16:19). The same words are addressed to all of the Twelve in Matthew 18:18. Even more directly, at the end of John’s Gospel, the risen Christ appeared to the Eleven and said: Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained (John 20:22-23)."

They feared falling into serious sin after baptism, and enduring the public penances which were imposed.",
            "The Church has from its early years worked on the principle that the original leaders of the Christian community passed on their authority to forgive sins to those who succeeded them. Over the centuries, there has been a development in the way the Church has celebrated this sacrament of forgiveness. In earlier times, formal forgiveness for sin, or absolution, was reserved only for those who had committed very serious public sins like murder, adultery or apostasy. It was accompanied by a long period of severe public penance, and could normally be received only once in a lifetime.",
            "A change in the understanding of the sacrament came about in the sixth and seventh centuries. The Irish monks at the time were mainly responsible for this change. They developed the practice of forgiving sins in Jesus’ name as part of a more frequent private confession which included less serious sins. It became available to anyone who requested it, as often as seemed desirable. This eventually became the standard form of the sacrament, although in more recent times, the way in which the sacrament is celebrated has been modified to make it more helpful and fruitful for those who take part."

If someone lives or acts in such a way as to cut himself/herself off completely from God and the Church, he/she is said to be in a state of serious sin. This is often called mortal sin, because it kills the divine life within us, and drives God’s grace-presence from us: sin, when it is full grown, brings birth to death (James 1:15). The person in such a state has either explicitly or implicitly chosen freely, deliberately and knowingly to reject God.",

This rule exists because of the obligation on all Catholics to receive the Eucharist during this same period of time. But apart altogether from the law, there is great value in the regular celebration of the sacrament. We need to acknowledge frequently, if we are to grow spiritually: that we are sinners who need a sign of forgiveness; that we belong to a community which we have harmed by our sins and which therefore should have some part in our healing; that we need to declare ourselves publicly as followers of Jesus Christ and to share in his healing work; and that we need the assurance of God’s constant love despite our sinfulness."

They should call for the elders of the church and have them pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord.

Prior to the renewal of the liturgy since the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), the emphasis was on preparation for death, and it was referred to as ‘Extreme Unction’ (the Last Anointing) or ‘The Last Rites’. However, the Council restored an emphasis on prayer for physical and spiritual healing for all seriously ill persons. The sacrament should not be deferred until the person is dangerously ill and on the point of death. Elderly people in a weak condition may be anointed, even though there is no question of any danger of death. The power of the sacrament to restore bodily as well as spiritual health is sufficient reason for its not being delayed. Moreover, there is no reason why a person may not receive this sacrament a number of times in the course of his or her lifetime, as often as it is judged to be called for. The sacrament of Anointing may also be celebrated as part of a Eucharistic celebration.",

Nevertheless, our God is a healing God who often responds to the prayer of Christians and works through the sacrament to restore to health those who are suffering.",

Viaticum is the last sacrament of Christian life and involves the reception of the Body and/or the Blood of Christ, either in the context of Mass or outside Mass.",

It reminds us of the words of Jesus: Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day (John 6:54). If the celebration of Viaticum is not possible, there is also provision for Prayers for the Dying which are said as the seriously-ill person enters the final moments of life. In the case where a priest is called to a person who has already died, he will not administer the sacrament because sacraments can only be received by the living. In this case, the priest or deacon will offer prayers for God’s forgiveness and for the reception of the person into the kingdom of heaven. If there is doubt about whether or not the person is already dead, the priest may administer the sacrament conditionally."

            "The Catholic tradition firmly believes in the permanency of the marriage bond. The Church also understands that each person’s life story is unique, and that the expectation of making a permanent and loving commitment at the moment of consent (the ‘Exchange of Promises’ during the wedding liturgy) might not have always been possible. Whenever ‘divorce’ has been part of a person’s history, Catholics who wish to re-marry in the Church must enter into a carefully regulated legal system through a regional marriage tribunal. This is also true for those who wish to be fully-initiated into the Catholic tradition and have been divorced and are, or seek to be, remarried. Given that each person’s situation is different and that this is a highly-specialised area, specific questions or concerns are best addressed by trained experts in the area of Church law.",
            "There are some important distinctions which need to be made. A marriage between a baptised and non-baptised person is considered a true marriage, but not a sacramental marriage. A marriage between two baptised people is considered sacramental because of the Christian witness they give through their married vocation and their ministry to one another. Depending upon the particular and individual circumstances, the Church has a number of distinct processes and procedures.",
            "A term which is commonly used to describe these processes is ‘annulment’. It should be noted that not every process of dissolving a marriage will involve an annulment. Annulments are distinct from civil divorce and are official Church declarations by the Marriage Tribunal that the agreement made by a couple on their wedding day was not the binding agreement it was thought to be. An annulment or decree of nullity frees the parties to enter a marriage according to the rites of the Catholic Church once all other requirements of canon law have been fulfilled.",
            "A decree of nullity does not mean that there was never any love between the parties, that they were lacking sincerity, effort or commitment. Nor does it mean that there was no marriage as generally understood by the community at large. It does mean that the promises made on the wedding day, for a particular reason or reasons, did not have the binding force those present at the wedding thought they had.",
            "Individual circumstances always vary and some situations may be relatively straight-forward and others more complex. In all these circumstances, the Church is attempting to hold in tension its vision for a loving and lasting commitment in marriage, while at the same time acknowledging the realities of human failures and frailties. The prayerful and gracious support of the community of faith is a profound aid to those who find themselves in such circumstances."

        "From among his many followers, Jesus chose a group of twelve men to whom he devoted special attention and gave special instruction and formation. It was these who after Jesus’ resurrection and return to his Father, saw themselves as having the major responsibility for carrying on his mission and ministry. In the early years of Christianity, they came to be known as apostles, although the term apostle was also applied to others who were not members of the original Twelve. Paul, for example, strongly defended his right to be called an apostle (which means literally ‘one who is sent’).",
        "As we have seen in earlier sessions, the Twelve were given by Jesus the authority to forgive sins. They were also commanded to do in memory of him what he did at the Last Supper, when he pronounced over the bread and wine the words This is my body ... this is my blood, and gave it to them to eat and drink (Matthew 26:26,28).",
        "During his time on earth, Jesus demonstrated by both his words and actions that he understood the mission entrusted to him by his Father in terms of service. His life was lived entirely in the service of others, and on several occasions he reminded his disciples that authority and leadership in his community had to be exercised in the same spirit and for the same purpose. At the Last Supper, as a final lesson to them, he performed the humble task of washing their feet and called on them to act in a similar fashion. Finally, Jesus crowned his life of service and self-sacrifice by allowing himself to be led to the cross and to death in obedience to his Father’s will and as a sacrifice for the sins of the world.",
        "Before his return to the Father, Jesus promised his disciples that he would not leave them to act alone. He told them he would not leave them orphans, but he assured them he would send the Holy Spirit to empower them. After his resurrection he concluded his final words of instruction to them with the promise: I am with you always, to the end of the age (Matthew 28:20).",
        "The Gospel of Matthew concludes with these words: Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. ... Jesus came and said to them, ‘All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.’ (Matthew 28:17-20)."

            "The New Testament does not give us any consistent pattern of the way the original leaders of the Christian community appointed others to succeed them, or how they conferred on others the authority that Jesus had given to them. The ‘laying on of hands’ was evidently an important element in setting people apart for special ministry. Thus in Acts chapter 6, the Twelve ask that seven men should be designated by the Jerusalem community to minister to the poor, so that they might themselves be free to preach the word of God. We are told that the community chose seven and set them before the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them (Acts 6:5-6). Later in Acts we find that along with the apostles, there was a group of ‘elders’ in the Jerusalem community. These are evidently local church leaders, and presumably they were designated by the apostles in the same way as the seven ministers.",
            "In Acts 13, we are told that while they (the community at Antioch) were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, ‘Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them’. Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off (Acts 13:2-3). There follows an account of an extensive missionary tour by Saul (Paul) and Barnabas, as they took the gospel of Christ to Cyprus and Asia Minor. Towards the end of this campaign, Luke, the author of Acts, tells us Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for them in each church (Acts 14:23).",
            "The second letter to Timothy, written towards the end of the first century, informs us that Paul laid hands on Timothy to set him apart for the ministry, and reminded him to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands (2 Timothy 1:6). By the end of the century, it seems clear that in all the local churches there were presbyteroi (elders or presbyters) or episkopoi (overseers or bishops) who had pastoral and administrative care of their communities. The laying on of hands accompanied by prayer by which these local leaders were designated is seen as the beginning of the sacrament of Holy Orders or ordination, and also the beginning of what is known as ‘apostolic succession’.",
            "After they had received the promised gift of the Spirit at Pentecost, they began their mission in obedience to Christ’s command. The book of the Acts of the Apostles shows them responding to his call to ministry in many different ways – preaching the gospel, curing the sick and caring for the poor. They also began to share their ministry with others – delegating to some the ministry of preaching and to others the ministry of serving the needy. As new needs arose, new members were summoned to meet those needs."

            "Significantly there is no mention of Christian priests in the New Testament. The only priests mentioned are Jewish priests and the word is never applied to the apostles, or to the elders – overseers. Jesus alone is designated as priest, our great high priest, and then only in one New Testament writing, the letter to the Hebrews. This suggests that the notion of priesthood was an idea which needed time to develop as Christians grew in self-understanding. This development no doubt paralleled their growing understanding of the Eucharist from messianic banquet, to memorial, to sacrificial meal. The disappearance of the Jewish priesthood after the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in 70 AD would have accelerated the understanding that Christians had their own sacrifice (the Eucharist) and needed a priesthood to offer it.",
            "Catholics have traditionally seen the Last Supper as the occasion when Jesus instituted both the Eucharist and the priesthood, and the Council of Trent has defined that Christ indeed instituted the sacrament of Orders on that occasion. One need not however understand this definition to mean that the Twelve considered themselves to have been ordained priests by Jesus on the eve of his death. What Trent intended to affirm was that the Eucharist and the priesthood are so essentially related to what Jesus did at the Last Supper, that in the theological sense they can be said to have been instituted there. The elements of the later Christian priesthood are to be found in Christ’s words and actions at the Last Supper, but it required time for this to be fully appreciated and understood.",
            "By the late first century AD, we have evidence for the existence in the Church of presbyters and bishops (or overseers) – the terms seem to be interchangeable in the New Testament – and deacons. By the middle of the second century, as a result of further development, a much clearer structure had emerged with a ‘three-tiered’ leadership: a single bishop in each local church, assisted by a group of presbyters and deacons. This soon became the norm for the entire Catholic world. The Catholic Church has preserved this basic pattern of official leadership and succession from the second century down to the present day."

Every civilisation has recognised the need to worship and has set aside people whose principal task it has been to represent the whole people before God. Among the Israelites, the people of the Old Testament, there was no ordained priesthood, strictly speaking. One family, the family of Levi, was designated as the priestly family, and all male members born unto this family served the people of Israel as its priests.",
            "The priest was regarded as someone set apart, chosen, called by God. His task was to consult God, to teach the law and to offer sacrifices on behalf of the people. They thus functioned as mediators between God and the people. At first, the sacrifices were the first fruits of the crops, or animals, but eventually it came to be realised that what God wanted above all was the sacrifice of a ‘humble and contrite heart’, of which the other offerings were merely symbols. With the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD, and the end of sacrifice as an element of Jewish Liturgy, the priesthood of Israel disappeared from history."

This means that Jesus’ priesthood is shared in a sense by all believers. All members of the Church have been called and chosen, and have the responsibility to carry on Christ’s mission. This responsibility comes in the first place through Baptism and is sealed by Confirmation. Through the Spirit, Christ shares his gifts with us, enabling us to carry out our mission. Paul elaborates on how the various gifts of the Spirit help us to live out our call to service (1 Corinthians 12:4-11). While there is a common mission which belongs to all members of the priestly people there is at the same time a variety of ministries, and among them are the ordained ministries of the deacon, the priest and the bishop."

As such, they are a sign of the universality and diversity of the Church, and by their ministry they strive to promote unity among the people of God. They possess a three-fold ministry which may be summarised by the words prophet, priest and shepherd, words which apply directly to Christ but can by extension be applied to the bishop and indeed to every priest.",

To his brother priests his duty is to be a friend and support, advisor and counsellor.",

There are different orders or degrees of ordained ministry and the bishop, who is highest in rank, is said to have the fullness of priesthood. Priests, although they act with a certain amount of independence, are in fact coworkers of the bishop, and share in his ministry. Sacramentally, the main difference between bishops and priests is that the former can ordain other bishops and priests, and are by office the official proclaimers of the word and celebrants of the liturgy in their dioceses. The bishop also ordinarily confers the sacrament of Confirmation, although this is a function which he may delegate to his priests."

Both also make it clear that celibacy is not a call given to the majority, but that it is a gift that enables some followers of Christ to devote their individual attention to the affairs of the Lord and his kingdom. Since the early Church, men and women have committed themselves to God in this way. Celibacy is a sign or witness in that it involves renouncing some undeniably good things – sexual pleasure within marriage and the good of married life – for another good: greater freedom to devote time and attention to the Lord and to the building up of his body, the Church for the sake of the kingdom.",

However, the intention behind Jesus’ words is that no human being may be given the honour and respect due only to God the Father. One should also take note of the words of Paul in 1 Corinthians 4:15: For though you might have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers.

It is a law of the Church which could be changed if it were thought to be necessary or desirable, because celibacy is not an absolute requirement for priesthood. The Eastern rites of the Catholic Church allow married men to be ordained to the priesthood, a practice which reflects their culture and Christian tradition. There are particular circumstances where married men are ordained to priesthood. In such cases, these men had previously been ordained and served as ministers in other Christian traditions and have since been received into the Catholic Church. In recent times, special structures have been established within the Catholic Church to receive former Anglican clergy and lay people into full communion, while retaining dimensions of their Anglican disciplines and rituals.",

            "At the most practical level, celibacy is advantageous from the point of view of time and economics. While there are good arguments in favour of a married priesthood, there is also no doubt that a celibate priest has the time and freedom to be available, mobile and committed to a degree that would be difficult for a responsible married man with a family (see 1 Corinthians 7:32-34). At the same time, we must acknowledge the commitment and dedication of married clergy throughout the Christian world. Certainly the requirement of celibacy should not be seen as a negative evaluation of the married state, and there seems little to be gained by discussing the relative merits of the two states, or the superiority of one over the other.",

In 1994, St John Paul II issued an apostolic letter Ordinatio Sacerdotalis (On Reserving Priestly Ordination to Men Alone) in which he declared that the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women, and that this judgement is to be definitively held by all the faithful. Subsequently the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith affirmed that this teaching was part of ‘the deposit of faith’. It described the Pope’s decision as a teaching that has been set forth infallibly by the ordinary and universal magisterium or teaching authority of the Church. Therefore, the Roman Catholic Church considers the discussion of ordaining women to the priesthood closed.",

These titles distinguish the different roles, orders or functions of these ministers. The important thing is that they all share in the one priesthood of Christ as ministers set apart for leadership and service in the Body of Christ. As we have said earlier, the Catholic understanding is that the bishops (a category which includes the Pope, archbishops and most cardinals) possess ‘the fullness of the sacrament of Orders’, while priests and deacons share in and extend the priestly ministry of their bishop. This understanding is based on the way ordained leadership actually evolved and functioned in the history of the Church, which Catholics believe was directed by the Holy Spirit.",

A number of other Christian traditions ordain women, and many theologians have argued that there are no obvious theological reasons standing in the way of the ordination of women. They point to the significant role women played in the ministry of Jesus and claim that the exclusion of women is not a matter of doctrine, but of cultural inheritance.

If the Protestant reformers had not singled out the papacy, the institution of bishops, and the ordained priesthood as special targets of attack, the respective roles of clergy and laity would probably not be exactly as they are in the present day Church.",
            "But it was not always so. In the early Church there are examples of lay people baptising, electing clergy and even bishops. They attended Church councils and spoke up in matters of doctrine. In the New Testament, as we have seen, the whole Christian people is addressed as a priesthood – which has given rise to the expression, priesthood of the laity.",
            "The centralisation had its advantages in terms of solidity and uniformity, but there were negative side effects: the bishops grew more passive in relation to the Pope, as did the clergy with regard to the bishop, and the laity vis-a-vis the priest. A situation arose where lay involvement in the Church’s affairs came to be seen almost as superfluous. The Church’s work was understood to be the business of the professionals – Pope, bishops, priests and religious.",
            "It was partly as the result of these assaults at the time of the reformation, that later theology came to emphasise so strongly a centralised authority and the ordained ministry in the Church, at the expense of shared authority and other forms of ministry. Inevitably, papal power grew at the expense of the college of bishops; in the diocese, the bishop’s power grew at the expense of the clergy; and the priests’ power grew at the expense of the laity."

            "Prior to the second Vatican Council the level of lay participation in decision-making at all levels was very low. As a result of the Council, a different picture of the Church began to emerge. Just as Pope John XXIII was surrounded by his Bishops in Council in 1962, so today the Pope is with his Synod of Bishops; the diocesan bishop with his presbyterate (body of priests); the parish priest with his council of laity – these are meant to be expressions of the Church which the Council wanted to promote. The creation or re-creation of these structures is part of the renewed emphasis on the common mission of the whole people of God.",
            "These new structures in no way supplant or undermine the offices of Pope, bishop or priest. They rather complement them and provide them with a context in which they can better realise their full meaning. From what we have said, it should be clear that the lay person’s call to ministry does not derive from any state of emergency in the Church – such as a shortage of priests (as Pope Pius XI suggested was the case). There is no denying that there is a scarcity of vocations to the ordained ministry: the Church does need more priests."

To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good (12:4-7). A little later on, he writes: Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it.

It is a failure to recognise what Paul recognised in his own case: that the power of God is often most effective when it operates through human weakness.",

The Spirit was given to the first disciples of Jesus, precisely when they were all together and of one mind in prayer and love (Acts 1:14; 2:1). The Spirit is the principle of unity in the Church. The Spirit dwells within each of us as a kind of inner law of unity and community. If a person’s bodily members are separated from one another, they cease to live. So too, the Holy Spirit who is the principle of personal faith and of the individual Christian life, binds the members of the Church together. The Spirit brings together in unity the gifts which are implanted in individual persons."

            "Ministry is a word that is frequently used in many different ways. The word ‘ministry’ is a translation of the Greek word diakonia. Over the last couple of decades, the precise theological meaning of this term has been debated both through scholarly research and ecumenical dialogue. Historical research has shown that the ancient Greek word was used in very specific circumstances and in relation to particular tasks. It was not a word that was applied generally to all acts of loving service. In other words, not everything was seen as ‘ministry’. However, ecumenical dialogues tend to highlight baptism as the basis for Christian ministry. In this context, every baptised person is understood to be, in some form, a ‘minister’.",
            "Ministry finds its clearest expression in the three-fold ministry of Christ: priest, prophet and king. All the baptised share in these dimensions of Christ’s service. Ministry, therefore, is clearly broader than simply ordained ministry. Nevertheless, ministry is a specific term that relates to particular roles within the Church which are clearly based in the person and ministry of Jesus Christ, is nourished and supported by necessary gifts and gives life to the Body of Christ.",
            "What can be said about ministry is this: firstly, it is about the person of Jesus Christ and is related to his service to the world. In this sense, ministry is ‘symbolic’ because it shows forth Jesus and not the minister. Secondly, ministry emerges from ‘charismatic’ gifts, that is ‘God-given gifts’, which are called forward by the Church into ministry. And lastly, the purpose of ministry is to build up the Body of Christ to enable all to share in a deeper unity and come to a deeper faith."

The Church is a sign of unity and an instrument of God’s peace. It is God’s partner in the proclamation of the gospel to the ends of the earth.",

What do I consider good in life?’ As small children, almost all the practical decisions were made for us by other people, and we had little opportunity to choose.

So the moral life is about who we are and who we are going to be.",

Instead it became part of our being that to do this was right, and to do that was wrong, because it was good or bad. We understood that standing behind what was ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ was what was good or bad. In other words, our conscience had begun to grow and guide our actions from within us and we assumed more responsibility for our own choices.",

It indicated how they should respond to God’s covenant invitation, you shall be my people, and I will be your God (Ezekiel 36:28). They also believed that the Law revealed the wisdom of their God and living by God’s Law demonstrated the wisdom of Israel (Deuteronomy 4:6-8). Because Christians see themselves as the new people of God, the spiritual descendants of Israel, the Law will always stand. The Ten Commandments are not a list of arbitrary laws imposed at the whim of a capricious dictator, but an expression of what conforms to the very best in human nature.",
            "While the purpose of law is to give guidance for future activity, it also (to some extent) inevitably follows from, and reflects, the experience of past history. Those commandments which enjoin such values as respect for life, respect for truth, respect for parents, respect for marriage and family, and respect for another’s property are really statements of the ‘natural’ law. The attitudes and values which they enshrine were the fruit of human experience and reflection, people grasping what was good. They might even be said to be attitudes and values which a right conscience should acknowledge instinctively. It is not surprising therefore that similar ways of living were found also in other ancient codes of law.",
            "The promulgation of the Law (described from Exodus 19 onwards) was seen as a deeply significant moment in Jewish history. Exodus 19:4-8 is one of the classical passages of the Old Testament. To Moses, the chosen mediator, God makes an astonishing offer: having already delivered them from the hands of the Egyptians, if the Israelites will choose to abide by the covenant, they will in turn receive a privileged status as God’s own people, God’s treasured possession, a kingdom of priests, a holy nation (vv. 5-6). In this plan to save the world, they are given a special place and a unique intimacy with God. In turn, much will be demanded of them – they must be holy as God is holy. However, this special vocation was not forced on the people but left to their free choice. In verse eight, they readily accept the terms of the covenant.",
            "Jesus himself said that he did not come to abolish the Law but to complete it, fulfil it and perfect it. He even said that not even the tiniest part of this Law of God was to be done away with (Matthew 5:17-20). Many Old Testament rules and regulations dealing with temple sacrifice and ritual, legal purity and so on, became obsolete with the coming of Christ, but the Ten Commandments have a universal force and retain their permanent, binding character even in the Christian era."

This commandment embodies the truth of who God is, and the appropriate response to this truth. Recognition of this truth distinguished Israel from the neighbouring pagan countries, which all worshipped a whole host of gods and goddesses. Along with this went the prohibition against attempting to make images of the Divine. Again the purpose was to acknowledge the truth of their God, and once again it distinguished them from their neighbours, all of whom fashioned and worshipped images of their national gods. So the commandment was primarily a condemnation of idolatry. The original form of the commandment was probably something like this: ‘I, the Lord, am your God. You shall have no other gods besides me’.",

Later on, more and more precise requirements were drawn up about observance of the Lord’s day, but the commandment itself simply consecrates a period of time to God. Christians changed the special day for worship to the first day of the week, in honour of Christ’s resurrection on that day. The motivation given to observe this law is our need to imitate God, who ceased creative activity on the seventh day.",

The fact is that the devout Israelites of earlier days, before the Exile, had a very healthy attitude to God’s law. They saw the commandments as the way of life, a life of wisdom and love. They certainly did not consider them an oppressive burden, or the law of a God of wrath, but as an expression of the will of a God of love. Their observance of the Law was based not on fear, but on love and gratitude for the blessings they had received, and recognition of the wisdom of their God.",

A truer picture found in the Old Testament is that of God as Father of his people, a God of infinite mercy and compassion, one who perfectly understands the human condition, and while never condoning sin is always ready to forgive. The prayers of the Jewish people (especially the Psalms) clearly reflect this image of God. They display complete confidence in God as the one who saves. Emphasis on God’s readiness to forgive should not of course encourage the conclusion that God’s law is unimportant – far from it. God expects us to live under the guidance of this law and in this way to grow.",
            "This revelation of God to Israel formed the basis of Israel’s moral law, summarised in the Ten Commandments. Christians believe that God’s self-revelation reached its climax in the person of the Son, Jesus, the Word made flesh. The Exodus revealed to the Israelites a great deal about the love of God. But that love can be fully appreciated, only when it is seen revealed in the life and death of Jesus, God-made-man. In him we have the fullest possible insight into God’s character, especially God’s love and mercy; in him we also have the perfection of the pattern of call and response that runs throughout the story of revelation."

We learn of the love of God which is revealed in the gift of the law to us – God’s own people, and what our attitude ought to be when confronted with this law.

In the Sermon he showed how his teaching was intended to fulfil the purpose of the old law. He demanded of his disciples that their righteousness must surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees (Matthew 5:20). By this, he meant to show that doing God’s will must go further than mere observance of the Law. He was drawing attention to the negative formulation of the commandments, ‘Thou shalt not’, a formulation which necessarily implies a minimal moral response. The law of Christ invites a much more generous response. The new invitation is to perfection (Matthew 5:48), in other words, to live without setting limits.",

The command, live by the Spirit, that is, ‘act according to the Spirit’, clearly shows that the new life of freedom is a power which must be put into action. It demands actions which must be performed under the influence of the Holy Spirit, flowing from the interior gifts of the Spirit which the Christian possesses. Paul goes on to say that those who are led by the Spirit are not subject to the constraints of any external law dictating to them their duty.",
            "Because they are led by the Spirit, they can distinguish between the works of the flesh (Galatians 5:19-21) and the fruit of the Spirit (5:22-23). The Spirit-guided person instinctively turns aside from the things of the flesh. Having said that, we should not think of this comparison in a wholly dualistic way. A Christian understanding does not see ‘the flesh’ as opposed to ‘the spirit’ in a manner that would suggest that ‘flesh’ is bad and ‘the spirit’ good. Paul’s list of ‘works of the flesh’ includes not only sexual sins (as the term ‘flesh’ has come to suggest), but especially sins against love: enmity, strife, jealousy, anger, selfishness, and other attitudes and behaviours which cause disharmony and are destructive to the broader community.",
            "If truly led by the Spirit a Christian should spontaneously avoid such works of the flesh. Paul is here giving a list of those sins which the Spirit will help a person avoid, rather than putting forward a code of laws to serve as a basis for Christian living.",
            "Under the heading, ‘the fruit of the Spirit’, love is mentioned in the first place, suggesting that this gift includes all the rest. The one who follows the guidance of the Spirit instinctively practises the other virtues (patience, kindness, faithfulness, etc.), without being aware of the constraint of any law. Basic to Paul’s thinking is the futility of trusting in any law, because no law can give a person the power to overcome sin.",
            "St Thomas Aquinas states that this law: can be called law in two ways. First the law of the spirit is the Holy Spirit … who, dwelling in the soul, not only teaches what it is necessary to do by enlightening the intellect on the things to be done, but also inclines the affections to act with uprightness … Second, the law of the spirit can be called the proper effect of the Holy Spirit, and thus faith working through love which teaches inwardly about the things to be done … and inclines the affection to act. (In Epistulum ad Romansanos, c.VIII, lect.1, cited in The Splendour of Truth, no 45).",
            "In 1 Timothy 1:9, we are told that law is not for the righteous, but for sinners. If we were all righteous, there would be no need of any external laws. For example, Christians who receive the Eucharist every week or even daily, obviously have no need of any law requiring reception of Holy Communion once a year. They are obliged by the law, but they will fulfil it because they are led by the Spirit, not because of the demand of the law.",
            "But because everyone is a sinner to some extent, external law is necessary either to warn the lapsed that they are no longer following the lead of the Spirit, and so to indicate to them their sinful situation, or to help the faithful to recognise and avoid the works of the flesh. This is why Paul consistently gives moral exhortations and lays down rules of conduct. These precepts are intended simply to apply the interior law of the Spirit to the different circumstances of daily life. They all come back ultimately to the one law of love (Galatians 5:14). Paul would have been horrified at any suggestion that laws could put a person into a right relationship with God, or that they could ever be the dynamic principle of Christian living."

He was well aware, of course, that in this earthly life, a person, even though led and animated by the Spirit, can always lapse, because in this life we are not always filled with the right spirit. We struggle with sinful inclinations. We are never so liberated from the power of sin and the flesh that we cannot fall again under their sway. Our freedom is therefore imperfect. Until we are fully spiritual, we need external laws to help us distinguish between the works of the flesh and the fruits of the Spirit.",
            "God chose that the human person should be responsible for their own response to moral truth. Through our morally good acts we strengthen, develop and consolidate within ourselves our likeness to God. The more one does what is good, the freer one becomes. There is no true freedom except in the service of what is good and just. The choice to disobey and do evil is an abuse of freedom and leads to ‘the slavery of sin’ (Catechism of the Catholic Church 1733).",

Mere observance which is empty of love is not an exercise of Christian freedom. On the contrary, Christians who make a code of law the dominant element in their life renounce their freedom and become slaves once again to the law. As St Augustine said: Whoever avoids evil, not because it is evil but because of a commandment, is not free. The free person is the one who avoids evil because it is evil.",

            "As we have already seen in the previous section, there is a correspondence between the Law as revealed by God in the Old Testament and what human persons are able to grasp as good, what we call the natural law. This correspondence exists because both are concerned with moral truth. This is why Jesus did not come to abolish ‘the Law’. He could not abolish the truth, but he could deepen our understanding of it.",
            "Moral truth (and hence the moral good) is at the heart of moral law. Moral laws are not something we create ourselves. They are something we discover, or are revealed to us and recognised as true (as in the Old Testament). Moral laws point to the good which is to be protected, promoted and nourished.",
            "This is our starting point for understanding the relationship between law and freedom. St John Paul II discussed this extensively in his encyclical The Splendour of Truth (Veritatis Splendor, nn.35-53).",

            "With this imagery, Revelation teaches that the power to decide what is good and what is evil does not belong to man, but to God alone. The man is certainly free, inasmuch as he can understand and accept God’s commands. And he possesses an extremely far-reaching freedom, since he can eat ‘of every tree of the garden’. But his freedom is not unlimited: it must halt before ‘the tree of the knowledge of good and evil’, for it is called to accept moral law given by God. In fact, human freedom finds its authentic and complete fulfilment precisely in the acceptance of that law. God, who alone is good, knows perfectly what is good for man, and by virtue of his very love proposes this good to humans in the commandments. … God’s law does not reduce, much less do away with human freedom; rather, it protects and promotes that freedom.",
            "As we have already said, it is possible for human reason to grasp something of the moral good, without the assistance of Divine Revelation. But given the effects of fallen human nature Divine Revelation is an effective means of knowing moral truths, even those of the ‘natural order’. So there is no contradiction between Divine Revelation and human reason. Right reason is grounded in Divine truth.",
            "Genuine freedom is an outstanding manifestation of the divine image in the human person.",
            "Paul’s teaching on freedom is therefore not an invitation to self-indulgence or to licentious behaviour, you were called to freedom, brothers and sisters; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for self-indulgence, but through love become slaves to one another ... the whole law, he says, is summed up in a single commandment, ‘You shall love your neighbour as yourself’ (Galatians 5:13-14). Really there is nothing more demanding than the law of love."

        "Jesus’ ministry was predominantly a teaching ministry. His purpose was to lead people to God his Father. After his baptism by John, which marked  the beginning of his relatively brief public ministry, he made his headquarters the town of Capernaum, on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. However, his ministry was a largely itinerant one, and the Gospels tell us that wherever he went, he attracted large crowds of people, to whom he talked about the kingdom of God and about how they might discover the kingdom for themselves.",
        "The earliest Gospel, the Gospel of Mark, refers to this authoritative aspect of Jesus’ teaching from the very outset. This is how he describes the beginning of Jesus’ ministry: They went to Capernaum; and when the sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and taught. They were astounded at his teaching, for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes (Mark 1:21-22).",
        "Matthew in his Gospel makes the same comment at the conclusion of the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 7:28-29), and this is appropriate, because the authoritative tone of Jesus’ words is most striking in the Sermon. He presents himself there as the supreme interpreter of God’s will as we noted in the previous chapter.",
        "The first miracle described by Mark is the exorcism of a man with an unclean spirit in the Capernaum synagogue (Mark 1:23-27). Mark concludes his description with the comment: They were all amazed, and they kept on asking one another, ‘What is this? A new teaching – with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him’ (v. 27). Jesus’ calming of the storm at sea evokes a similar reaction: Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? (Mark 4:41)",
        "From the beginning, the Gospels report, his teaching made a deep impression on people, because he taught with authority, speaking from his personal experience of God his Father. His teaching was often accompanied by acts of healing or other powerful works which gave special weight to his words.",
        "A doctrine of the Church which has been the object of much discussion over the past century has been its infallibility.

In the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church (Gaudium et spes), the bishops of the Second Vatican Council declared: the entire body of the faithful, anointed as they are by the Holy Spirit, ... cannot err in matters of belief (no. 12).",
        "In other words when the people of God as a whole believes a certain truth of faith, or as Vatican II puts it, when they manifest a universal consent in matters of faith and/or morals, this is itself a guarantee of truth. In the history of the Church it can be shown that sometimes the people have expressed the faith better than their leaders. In the early centuries, the faith of the common people was largely responsible for preserving the truth about the nature of the divinity of Christ, when their leaders were silent or divided. Blessed John Henry Cardinal Newman (1801-1890) remarked that for a time the deposit of faith passed into the hands of the laity.",
        "The gift of infallibility belongs also to the bishops of the Church, the successors of the apostles. Jesus assured the Twelve as a group, and Peter in particular: whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven (Matthew 16:19; 18:18). He also told them, whoever listens to you listens to me (Luke 10:16), and his final promise was to be with them always, to the end of the age (Matthew 28:20). He promised he would send them the Spirit of truth, to be with them forever (John 14:16-17).",
        "The bishops have the responsibility to teach, and as a college, in union with the Pope and the whole people of God, they are guided by the Holy Spirit in their teaching. They express the faith of the Church for acceptance by the people of God. While they usually exercise their solemn teaching office when gathered together for a general Council, their individual day to day teaching also has particular (known as ‘ordinary’) authority."

The whole teaching of the gospel and the way it is understood in the Church is a major formative influence. If a person is brought up in a committed Christian family and environment, he or she shares in and is shaped by the conscience of the Church, the Church’s evaluation of human life. The Church forms in that person a Christian conscience, which enables him or her to assess things according to the mind of Christ himself.",

Such a person cannot be accused of a lack of obedience or respect, and in the case of the Church’s ordinary teaching, need not consider that conscientious dissent cuts him or her off from the sacramental life of the Church.",

It is also important to remember that those who struggle in an honest and sincere way with some aspect of the Church’s formal teaching can be the catalyst for further development or clarification of Church teaching. Nor does the inability to accept a formal teaching in the present preclude the possibility of acceptance at another stage of one’s faith journey.",
            "Finally, we may recall what we have said earlier about leadership in the Church being a leadership of service. Christ taught and showed his followers how to use their authority by being the servants of others. Pope and bishops therefore know they are called to be leaders in service. They try to be aware of, to judge, and to use the gifts that are distributed by the Spirit throughout the members of the Church. They know that many of the most important movements within the Church have been initiated by the Spirit among priests or lay people, and only later have come to their attention. For this reason, they should engage in a continual dialogue with their people, and be open to the Spirit who often speaks through the gifts of others. Recent popes, conscious of their call from Christ to lead by means of service of the people, have revived the title, ‘the servant of the servants of God’.",
            "Within the college of bishops and the Church as a whole, the Pope as successor of Peter occupies a unique position. The doctrine of the infallibility of the Pope was not formally defined until 1870, at the first (and unfinished) Vatican Council. Although it took more than eighteen centuries for the doctrine to be clearly formulated, or for its solemn proclamation to be considered necessary, it can be traced from the early centuries as a part of the developing concept of papal authority."

            "He also shared his authority with others. When he was sending the Twelve on a missionary tour of the nearby towns and villages, he gave them authority over the unclean spirits (Mark 6:7) and they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them. (Mark 6:13). However, on more than one occasion, Jesus impressed on his disciples that the only acceptable authority in his community was one of service: whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all (Mark 10:43-44). He proposed his own ministry as the model for this concept of authority: For the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many (Mark 10:45).",
            "Jesus’ concept of authority was clearly different from that exercised by secular rulers: You know that among the Gentiles those whom they recognise as their rulers lord it over them, and their great ones are tyrants over them. But it is not so among you (Mark 10:42-43). At his trial before Pilate, he affirmed: My kingdom is not from this world (John 18:36). His authority was to empower people, to build them up and enable them to lead full lives in union with the Father.",
            "The final act of Jesus before his return to the Father was to commission the Twelve (or the Eleven) disciples to teach in his name. Again from a mountain, he declared: All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age (Matthew 28:18-20).",
            "This is the Church’s fundamental mission. From then until now, the Church has always recognised the duty to teach all nations. The promise, ‘I am with you always’, is a promise given forever. Because the Church is the sacrament of Christ’s continuing presence and activity in the world, it continues to teach with the authority of Christ."

Although the Church’s basic teachings cannot be changed or denied, their formulation can grow, develop and change to express the truth more clearly, or in language more acceptable to contemporary men and women.",
            "Over the centuries, the Church has exercised its teaching authority mainly through its Councils of bishops. Already in the first century we read in Acts 15 of a gathering of the apostles and elders of the Jerusalem Church (about 50 AD) to settle the difficult question of whether converts from paganism should be obliged to observe the Jewish law.",
            "This Jerusalem assembly of Church leaders is often described as the first Council of the Church. The most recent Council was the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), which was attended by about 2500 bishops from all over the world. This Council was the major event in the Church in recent centuries. It ushered in the greatest development in the life of the Church since the Reformation which took place over 400 years previously. One of the important things to come out of the Council was a renewed vision of the Church, which stressed coresponsibility or shared responsibility for the Church’s mission among all its members.",
            "Of course, Jesus Christ himself, working through his Spirit, is the real leader of the Church. All human authority only represents him, and is his instrument. The Pope as Bishop of Rome, along with all the bishops throughout the world are known as ‘vicars of Christ’ or ‘representatives’ of Jesus Christ’s leadership. Under the leadership of the Bishop of Rome (the Pope), the whole college of bishops have responsibility for governing Christ’s Church.",

            "From the earliest days of the Church, the teaching authority and responsibility of its leaders were clearly recognised. The first writings of the New Testament were the letters of the apostle Paul, and his principal purpose was to teach. He used his letters to instruct, to correct, to guide, to rebuke, to encourage and to remind his converts of what he had taught them when he was with them. The second letter to Timothy, written probably by a disciple of Paul, reminds Timothy of his duty to proclaim the message; be persistent whether the time is favourable or unfavourable; convince, rebuke, and encourage, with the utmost patience in teaching (2 Timothy 4:2). This letter, written towards the end of the first century, shows what was expected of the leaders of local churches.",
            "We cannot deal with authority and obedience in the Church unless we have a proper understanding of the place of the Bishop of Rome, the Pope. In an earlier session on Peter and his role in the early Church, we touched briefly on the reasons why Catholics acknowledge and respect the Pope as the successor of Peter among the bishops, and the visible leader of Christ’s Church on earth. From the early centuries, the authority and leadership of the Roman Church was recognised by most of the Catholic world. When the church in Jerusalem died out at the end of the first century, the church of Rome began to take precedence. This was because it had been visited and taught by both Peter and Paul, and was the place of their martyrdom. From the second century onwards, it came to claim and receive a primacy over the other local churches, and was acknowledged as the centre of unity and the adjudicator of doctrinal and disciplinary disputes. Over time, the primacy of the church of Rome came to be extended to its bishop.",
            "When the bishops of the Catholic world met with Pope Pius IX for the first Vatican Council in 1870, they stated that in certain circumstances the Pope himself has the authority solemnly to express the faith of the Church. He does so only in specific circumstances when he is speaking on a matter of faith or morality, and when he makes it clear that he intends to use his authority in such a way as to call on the people of God for their faithful obedience to this defined truth, as part of what God has revealed. The technical term for this exercise of papal authority is that the Pope on such occasions speaks ‘ex cathedra’, that is, from the chair, the chair of Peter.",
            "Papal infallibility thus reflects in its teaching the faith of the whole Church. The Pope listens to the Church through all the means available to discover the true faith of the Church: prayer, study, consultation, deliberation. He does not receive private revelations, but neither does he need to take an opinion poll. He listens to the memory of the Church, the long Tradition of faith as held and expressed over the centuries. In his teaching he in turn, as chief pastor of the Church, expresses the faith of the whole community, in continuity with the Tradition of the Church and as a development of that Tradition. In its earliest understanding, infallibility was understood as a form of accountability. Popes were bound by the teaching that they have received and could not deviate from the foundations on which the Church was built. It was therefore not seen as a personal gift but as a strength and safeguard to preserving the faith of the Church.",
            "‘Religious submission of mind and will’ requires the renouncing of any attitude of obstinacy in one’s opinion, at the same time adopting an attitude of docility to the teaching in question. Renouncing obstinacy means rejecting any tendency to close one’s mind to the Church’s teaching or refusing even to give it a fair hearing. Docility is a willingness to be taught, a willingness to accept another’s judgement over one’s own when it is reasonable to do so. It calls for an open attitude towards the Church’s teaching, giving it a fair hearing, doing one’s best to appreciate the reasons in its favour, so as to leave oneself open to conviction about the truth and thus to be able to assent to it. A person without these attitudes can hardly be said to be acting in good conscience.",
            "Often a problem arises because a teaching of the Church is explained poorly or inadequately, and this can be remedied through honest and sincere dialogue. The role of well-formed pastors and lay ministers is essential in these circumstances. The pastoral responsibility of parish leaders is three-fold: firstly to accurately present the Church’s teaching; secondly, to clarify the centrality or otherwise of the Church’s teaching in question (is the concern with the teaching on the Trinity or a disagreement with a bishop’s comments on social issues or questions of personal morality); and thirdly, having listened carefully to the voice of the Church, the questioner is guided to consider their particular circumstance in the light of their conscience."

            "A correct appreciation of the teaching of Jesus about poverty and affluence depends to some extent on the Old Testament background to his ministry, for his language and many of his ideas were based on those writings, which for him and his Jewish contemporaries represented the word of God. The Old Testament perspective on poverty is not uniform, and sometimes ambiguous. There are some passages which indicate that material prosperity is a divine blessing, while poverty sometimes implies a punishment from God.",
            "The prophet Amos is scathing on those who trample on the poor ... and push aside the needy (5:11,12). He calls the people of Israel to let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream (5:24).",
            "With regard to wealth, the Old Testament in general sees its possession as acceptable if it is used to satisfy the needs of the less privileged in society. However, the unnecessary accumulation of worldly goods is severely judged, because this constitutes a challenge to the lordship of the God of Israel, and suggests a lack of faith and trust in God. Wealth is often linked with injustice, because the rich are often guilty of oppression of the poor, their wealth is frequently a source of pride, and the false security which it breeds turns its possessors away from trust in God.",
            "But even within this restricted framework, this narrow idea of divine justice is by no means typical of what the Old Testament has to say about poverty and the poor. In general, poverty is considered as an evil, because it causes undesirable relationships of oppression on the one hand and dependence on the other. It is seen as an abnormal situation, and one that needs correction.",
            "However, we must be aware of the limited horizons of the faith of ancient Israel, when there was no clear idea of any life or transcendent destiny beyond the present earthly existence. In the absence of any clear concept of an after-life, or final reward and punishment, divine favour and disfavour were often conceived and expressed in terms of this world and a person’s observed status: health, prosperity, long life and numerous descendants as signs of human virtue and God’s blessing and reward; while the opposite were seen as signs of God’s disfavour or punishment.",
            "Being reduced to a state of dependence, the poor are encouraged to be dependent on God. Since they were in a subordinate position, often oppressed and enslaved by others, whatever they received was not the result of their demands for they had no power, but solely the result of their successful appeals or pleas for mercy. One can easily see how this concept of the powerlessness of poverty took on a spiritual dimension. It was an easy step to seeing humility and weakness as favourable dispositions for being open to the saving activity of God, God’s liberating action and saving justice.",
            "The radical nature of Jesus’ message is seen in his challenge to those who aspired to be his disciples. He asked them in no uncertain terms to give up unconditionally their attachment to wealth, allowing no degrees or reservations: So therefore, none of you can become my disciple if you do not give up all your possessions (Luke 14:33). A powerful example of this is the story of the rich young man who approached Jesus wanting to become his disciple. When the young man found himself unable to accept the challenge to sell all he had and give the proceeds to the poor, Jesus commented to his disciples: How hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God (Mark 10:23). When the disciples showed their amazement at these words, he said it was easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.",
            "The demand to the rich man to share his wealth with the poor was intended to be a sign of his commitment to the kingdom of justice. The rejection of worldly wealth, in favour of those who had none, would be a clear sign that a fundamental change had taken place in the rich man’s heart. Instead of concentrating greedily on himself, he would now practise responsibility towards the underprivileged. This change meant conversion from self-sufficiency to an attitude of total dependence on God and God’s kingdom, and commitment to Jesus, the one who proclaimed it.",
            "The call of Jesus goes to the very heart of things. Its radical nature eliminated candidates who wanted to be disciples but were not sufficiently prepared to follow one who had nowhere to lay his head. It is not that poverty is proposed as a blessing or an ideal in itself, but voluntary acceptance will show that a person is ready to share the life of those who hope in the love and justice of God. We are thus called to identify with Jesus himself, and his voluntary acceptance of a humble status and the role of a servant, sharing what we have with the poor, because only thus can we live according to the gospel.",
            "Renunciation of the goods of this world is not an escape from the world. It does not mean turning one’s back on the good things the world has to offer, or denying oneself the enjoyment of them. It is rather a detachment from worldly possessions which is linked positively with the commandment of love. As Jesus told his disciples: ‘If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me’ (Matthew 16:24)."

Although he promised to remain with us always, it is the Church which is called to be the continuing sign of his saving presence and activity in the world, and a means, the most important means, of bringing God’s kingdom of justice to fulfilment. The Church is not the kingdom of God; it is God’s instrument for the advancement and the ultimate revelation of the kingdom. But obviously, the values which the Church espouses and makes her own must be the values of the kingdom, if we are to be faithful to the will of Christ.",
            "The Church must therefore identify with the poor, as he did. It is not just a matter of recognising the poor as an important part of the world, but the Church must recognise itself in the poor, so that the poor can recognise Christ in the Church. Unless this state of affairs is verified, the Church loses its own identity and fails to be fully the Church. To neglect this fundamental fact is equivalent to ignoring Christ’s birth in poverty and his life of poverty, and the whole tremendous mystery of the Incarnation."

We know there were people of high social status who listened and responded to his preaching, although they were not members of his closest group of disciples. This indicates that Jesus did not give up on the rich, or reject them, but rather he challenged them in various ways to follow the paths of justice, and be converted. However, his message was extremely tough for those who placed their hopes in wealth. In Luke’s Gospel he implied that they were fools (Luke 12:16-21) since wealth cannot justify a person in God’s sight, especially when it is not accompanied by social responsibility. This latter point is made most effectively in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31). In the passage which comes just before this parable, Jesus spells out his own position in relation to wealth: No slave can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate the one and love the other, or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth (Luke 16:13).",
            "This saying of Jesus is also found in Matthew’s Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 6:24) and is followed by his recommendation to trust in God’s righteousness, and all other needs will be satisfied. Here again we have another allusion to the ‘poor of Israel’s God’, who set their sights on the fulfilment of God’s promises, and do not put their trust in earthly possessions."

Religious or voluntary poverty means living life with basic simplicity and necessity. Voluntary acceptance of poverty is, therefore, an act of love. Just as the real cause of people’s exploitation and alienation is selfishness, so the deepest reason for voluntary poverty is love of neighbour. Christian poverty has meaning only as a commitment of solidarity with the poor, those who suffer misery and injustice. The commitment is to witness to the evil that has resulted from sin and destroys communion. Because of this solidarity, we can help the poor and exploited to become aware of exploitation and seek liberation from it.",
            "The challenge of poverty to the Church should provoke an attitude of witness and action of a prophetic character: an announcement of the justice of God and a denunciation of human injustice. It is not something that can be expressed just by words, but by a way of living.

It cannot be said that God decides or condones that some will be rich and others poor. There is in the world a clear disparity in the distribution of the products of human labour and the world’s resources, but that cannot be attributed to God’s will.

Hence, his radical demand that the rich young man, who wanted to be his disciple, should dispose of his possessions and give the proceeds to the poor.",

It remains an evil in the sight of God, something He wants to see eradicated, and this is why Jesus attacks the accumulation of wealth by the rich.

If this is the case, their attitude becomes one of idolatry, because they worship Mammon (wealth) rather than God.",

No other New Testament passage makes this more clear than the famous passage of Matthew 25:31-46, where Jesus paints a dramatic picture of the final judgement. The hungry, the thirsty, the stranger, the naked, the sick and the prisoner are identified with Jesus. They are his brothers and sisters. What is done to them is done to him. This text warns all those who aspire to follow Christ to remain on the alert to recognise his presence at all times, and to serve him by serving the poor.",
            "This passage is of vital importance to our understanding of the Church. It even defines our faithfulness to Jesus Christ. His earthly existence was a clear demonstration of what it was to be really poor. As a result, the poor were able to have confidence in him, could see in him the seeds of hope, and hear in his teaching the expression of justice and love. So must it be with the Church. Just as Jesus centred his heart on ‘the poor’ in his midst, so too must the Church continually centre its heart on the impoverished, needy and vulnerable. It must do so in word and deed. Anything less is a betrayal of the gospel."

Jesus called the attention of the disciples to her action. He seems to speak in admiration of her generosity and her sacrifice, comparing it with the offerings of the rich who contributed no more that they could afford. Their contribution did not hurt them at all: they would not even miss what they gave, whereas she donated everything she had (Mark 12:41-44).",
            "After this denunciation, Jesus sees the widow giving a small offering, something she could not really afford, to the Temple. He points out her action to the disciples, but the Gospel does not really say whether he was impressed, or admired her action, or whether he was sad or angry. Was he perhaps really expressing his anger that one of those who had already suffered so much at the hands of dishonest and unscrupulous lawyers, was now contributing the little amount she had left to the religious establishment?",
            "If we take this second interpretation of the story as a more valid, or equally valid one, we are reminded again that Jesus was not just someone who taught his followers to be humble and self-sacrificing, but also one who was concerned about social justice, about poverty, about the exploitation of the poor by the rich.",
            "The clear implication is that the Church, comprising those who claim to be his followers, must also be concerned about the inequalities and injustices in our society today.",
            "This picture of the widow as a figure of admiration, and an example of generosity and self-sacrifice, is the traditional way of understanding this episode. But there is another way. Immediately prior to the story of the widow, Jesus was castigating the scribes, the religious leaders for – among others things – they devour widows’ houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers (Mark 12:40). As well as being religious leaders, the scribes were also civil lawyers. Jesus’ attack on them suggests they had a reputation for exploiting widows after the death of their husbands, and fleecing them of their inheritance and their property.",
            "Of course the Gospel acknowledges that a person’s material needs must be met. Jesus warned that man does not live by bread alone, but that implies he cannot live without bread. He told his disciples to pray: Give us this day our daily bread. But to ask for bread today does not mean wanting more bread than is necessary, especially if the accumulation of wealth means that others will go without their daily bread.",
            "There is a danger in over-simplifying the teaching of Jesus, by saying that following Christ is the equivalent of being poor. We have seen how Matthew substitutes ‘poor in spirit’ for Luke’s simple designation of the poor. Unfortunately not every poor person is poor in spirit. One who is materially poor can also be proud, avaricious and intolerant. Material poverty is not a blessing, however there is certainly a connection between poverty and poverty of spirit in the sight of God.",
            "The teaching and activity of Jesus reveal a definite advance on the Old Testament outlook. First of all, there is no New Testament echo of those Old Testament passages which suggest material prosperity is a sign of God’s favour. Secondly, in the Old Testament, wealth is seen as something which can be an obstacle to any real commitment to God’s justice, but the alternative proposed by Jesus is not found there. Some of the prophets like Jeremiah pointed the way to what Jesus would propose, but we do not find in the Old Testament any explicit invitation to renounce the accumulation of wealth or to adopt the attitude and lifestyle of poverty. The other advance is of course the example of Jesus himself, who called on his disciples to imitate his example of humbling himself, taking on the form of a servant (Philippians 2:6-8), and becoming poor (2 Corinthians 8:9).",
            "A prevalent misunderstanding of the Christian gospel is that faith is a purely personal, private matter, between each person and God, to the exclusion of everyone and everything else. The gospel is not just a matter of accepting Jesus as one’s personal Lord and Saviour – the slogan of the fundamentalist, evangelical churches. The message Jesus left us is one of the need for care and concern for one another, and if necessary, to work to correct the wrongs and injustices done to others, and to change the structures responsible for them. Christian love demands this. There is no private way to God that ignores the needs of others. There can be no authentic acceptance of Jesus as one’s personal Lord and Saviour, if it is deaf to the cries of the poor. Concern for social justice is close to the heart of the gospel message.",
            "Whereas the rich person was self-sufficient, having amassed such wealth and power as no longer to feel the need to be dependent on anyone, God included, the poor on the other hand, with no worldly goods to support them or any worldly influence to count on, look to God alone as the only possible hope of liberation, the one alone who could give them justice. This comes up again and again in the psalms, the great prayers of Israel.",
            "Jesus’ teaching was obviously a source of hope for the poor. First it foreshadowed an end to their misery. Secondly, his proclamation of the kingdom implied that God’s judgement was at hand, and divine judgement implied in turn that justice would be done. The very term ‘kingdom of God’ conjured up the image of the ideal king, whose duty it would be to administer justice among his subjects, guaranteeing the rights of the weak and defenceless in the face of the rich and powerful, at the same time repressing these who threatened the rights of the poor.",
            "This vision helps to explain the popularity of the preaching of Jesus among the crowds of ordinary people who followed him.",
            "This spiritual, religious view of poverty did not exclude the physical or economic aspects, but it somehow transcended them. However, although such a spiritualising of poverty might appear to some to smack of the ‘opium of the people’ syndrome, it did not mean that the poor simply became resigned to their fate, and accepted the scandal of poverty and injustice in their lives, while waiting passively for some divine intervention. It did mean that their first priority was to address themselves to God whom they saw as their ultimate source of hope and justice and who they believed would come to save them."

            "At the same time, the tradition of the prophets remained alive, those who worked to bring about reforms in the life of the people and to attack the basic causes of poverty. The prophets passionately denounced poverty as an evil – the consequence of the injustice of the powerful. They were not prepared to admit it was the result of chance or blind fate. Men like Isaiah, Jeremiah and Amos pleaded for a just society according to the ideals of the covenant. They saw the condition of the poor as an attack on the solidarity of the people of God, and paid particular attention to the plight of slaves, widows and orphans, beggars and the disinherited. For the prophets, acceptance of poverty and the unjust structures which caused it, meant a regression to the people’s pre-Exodus condition of slavery in Egypt.",
            "But the prophetic message was not just a series of negative denunciations. Their criticism of the status quo was intended to alert people to what needed to be changed. (They attacked the excessive accumulation of wealth, because they saw the exploitation which accompanied and followed such unrestrained activity.)"

            "This outline of the Old Testament approach to poverty and the poor sets the scene for the arrival of Jesus on the world’s stage. Jesus was introduced to the people by John the Baptist, whose own message of the need for repentance included the demand of charity to the poor, as a preparation for receiving the Messiah. In concrete terms, he demanded that people share their food and clothing with those who had none; that tax collectors must collect no more than their due; soldiers must rob no-one by violence or by false accusation (Luke 3:10-14). Later on, when John sent a delegation to ask Jesus if he was the one that was expected, Jesus answered in terms which confirmed John’s requirements: the blind receive their sight; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; the dead are raised up; and the poor have good news preached to them (Luke 7:22).",
            "So Jesus clearly indicated that he saw mission to the poor as an essential part of proclaiming the kingdom of God. Luke’s Gospel is sometimes referred to as the Gospel of social justice. In Luke’s Gospel the first recorded words of Jesus after he began his ministry were a quote from the prophet Isaiah: The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free (Luke 4:18-19).",
            "By adding the words, today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing (Luke 4:21), Jesus emphasised that his ministry would give a privileged place to the poor and the disadvantaged, and announce to them hope of relief from their sufferings."

            "This emphasis is clearly stated in the passage we call the Beatitudes, which opens the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew’s Gospel (Matthew 5:3-11). It is however the parallel passage in Luke (6:20ff) which probably gives the original form of these pronouncements of Jesus. There Jesus refers not only to the poor in spirit (Matthew) but those who are actually poor and hungry and sorrowful.",
            "He says that as a result of his coming they are specially blessed for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them. We have here a continuation of the Old Testament idea that because they have nothing, the poor are more likely to be open to the saving activity of Jesus, and thus more prepared to receive his promise of salvation.",
            "This spiritual or religious view of poverty came to the fore in the last few centuries before Christ, because Israel’s history had been one of sad experience of the futility of pinning its hopes on kings and rulers. The ordinary religious people, who were predominantly poor, were those who waited on the Lord in a spirit of expectancy, in an attitude of spiritual childhood and humility, open to receiving whatever God had to offer. It was ideas such as these which laid the basis for the idea of the ‘faithful remnant’ of Israel, the ones who would experience God’s salvation. Faithfulness to the Lord meant waiting patiently for God’s coming in all humility and poverty. It was among these that messianic hope was strongest. Typical examples of this category at the time of Jesus were the pious and elderly Simeon and Anna, who are described in Luke’s Gospel as looking for the consolation and redemption of Israel (Luke 2:25-38). Mary must also be included among them, as seen by the outlook expressed by her in her ‘Magnificat’ (Luke 1:46-55).",
            "An important and positive part of the prophetic message was the announcement of God’s will – what they believed God wanted to see take place in human history. The struggle against poverty was therefore conceived as collaboration with God in implementing God’s plan for God’s people. The Jewish people were called to join in God’s action to correct injustices and establish righteousness on earth. Seeking to eradicate poverty was seen as a sign of one’s fidelity to God. Realism however led to the recognition that those who would take up this struggle would be precisely those who had practical experience of what it meant to be poor. It was this experience which led many men and women in Israel to adopt an attitude of humble dependence on God, and of trust in God’s grace. This was not because they idealised poverty, or saw it as having any value of blessing in itself. But poverty did take on for them a definite religious significance; it called on them to open themselves to God, and prepared them to receive God’s gifts. Though their needs were often very worldly, the poor were still the ones most ready to receive the Messiah (Christ) into their homes and into their hearts.",
            "Jesus could declare the poor to be blessed or happy, because the apparent fulfilment of their messianic hopes in him must have inspired happiness in them. But if their poverty and oppression did not immediately disappear, would not such declarations be destined to lead to disappointment and even despair? There must then be a further reason for his description of the poor as happy or blessed. However, we should not imagine that Jesus intended the poor to resign themselves to their condition, on the grounds that later, in the kingdom, the injustice would be rectified. The words of Jesus invite not resignation, but hope. The kingdom of God is something which broke into history in a new and decisive way in the ministry of Jesus. The elimination of the exploitation and poverty that prevents the poor from being fully human has begun, with the proclamation of a kingdom of justice that will put an end to their misery. Poverty is an evil, and therefore incompatible with the kingdom of God, which is intended to bring happiness to all those living in unhappiness and misfortune. They are the ones meant to benefit most from the new era of salvation inaugurated by Jesus."

We are called to look at political, social and economic decisions and ask, ‘How do they affect the poor?’ The ‘option for the poor,’ is not a slogan of class struggle or revolution.

Pope Francis points out that this ‘dominion’ is never interpreted as absolute for this can lead to the unbridled exploitation of nature (On Care of Our Common Home 67).

            "Theology, philosophy and science are all leading us to a greater discovery of the mysterious and harmonious unity of creation. The planet is in truth a fine and delicate balance of life. While God invites us to explore it and utilise it, we must at the same time, respect the integrity of creation and never exploit it. The earth is ultimately our common heritage whose fruits are meant for the benefit of all: The goods of creation belong to humanity as a whole (St John Paul II, World Day of Peace 1990).",
            "The first educator will always be the family. It is here that we teach the child to respect her or his neighbour and to love nature. It is the next generation which is becoming the great teacher of the previous generation. Many parents and grandparents are being taught by the youngest to respect the environment and change behaviours of consumption. St John Paul II saw the growing concern for the health of the environment as one of the signs of hope that the Holy Spirit provides for our times.",
            "For this integral ecology to develop Pope Francis believes two values (that have often not been esteemed in modern society) are required: sobriety and humility. Once we lose our humility, and become enthralled with the possibility of limitless mastery over everything, we inevitably end up harming society and the environment. It is not easy to promote this kind of healthy humility or happy sobriety when we consider ourselves autonomous, when we exclude God from our lives or replace him with our own ego, and think that our subjective feelings can define what is right and what is wrong (224).",
            "Just as the Works of Mercy call us to act compassionately towards our neighbour Pope Francis is asking us to act with mercy towards the earth herself, burdened and laid waste … We have forgotten that we ourselves are dust of the earth (cf. Genesis 2:7); our very bodies are made up of her elements, we breathe her air and we receive life and refreshment from her waters (2).",
            "Today a Christian spirituality and lifestyle is often counter to the prevailing culture. The ancient tradition of less is more, as exemplified by the Desert Fathers (and Mothers) and monastic orders in the middle ages, is a prophetic stance against rampant consumerism. The Australian bishops have pointed out that we must examine our lives and acknowledge the ways in which we have harmed God’s creation through our actions and our failure to act (A New Earth: The Environmental Challenge, ACBC, 2002). But it is not just at the personal level that we are being challenged to make changes."

        "One of the most beautiful and consoling doctrines of the Catholic Church is what we call the ‘Communion of Saints’. This is the Church’s teaching to the effect that there is an unbreakable bond between the Church on earth, the saints in heaven and those experiencing purgatory. Each year in the Church’s liturgical calendar, two successive days of celebration bring this truth home to us. On November 1st, we honour all the saints in heaven, not only canonised saints – those who have been officially declared by the Church to be with God because of their lives of evident holiness – but all who have gone before us to share God’s eternal happiness. They include those relatives and friends whom we have known and loved in this life.",
        "At the moment of death, we will stand before God as we truly are. We will experience the presence of God, all the love and goodness of God, and we will be confronted with our own worthiness or unworthiness to enter this presence. In that confrontation, God need not judge us, since we judge ourselves.",

            "For those with no belief in an after-life, death is a frightening moment that should be postponed as long as possible. Even believers cling naturally to life as long as possible because of fear of the unknown and the unwillingness to leave loved ones, but their faith tells them that physical death is not the be-all and end-all of human existence, but marks a transition from life on earth to a richer, fuller life in the company of God for all eternity.",
            "The Scriptures teach us also that the resurrection of Jesus is our hope, his assurance to us that we will follow him. Paul says that by rising from death, Jesus has become the first-born of many brothers and sisters, and first-fruits of the harvest to come. Paul also speaks of the unending duration of this life beyond the grave – a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens (2 Corinthians 5:1). The bishops of the Second Vatican Council state: It is in regard to death that the human condition is most shrouded in doubt ... But a deep instinct leads them rightly to shrink from and to reject the utter ruin and total loss of their personality. Because they bear in themselves the seed of eternity, which cannot be reduced to mere matter, they rebel against death ... For God has called them, and still calls them to cleave with all their being to Him in sharing forever a life that is divine and free from all decay – Christ won the victory when he rose to life, for by his death he freed us from death (The Church in the Modern World no 18).",
            "The word judgement of itself does not imply condemnation. In many Old Testament passages which speak of God bringing judgement for the people, the meaning is that God will uphold and vindicate the rights of the innocent. It is only when people deliberately refuse to live by the covenant that God’s judgement turns against them.",
            "Jesus places judgement in the midst of daily life when he says that a person’ eternity will depend on how in this life he or she treats the hungry and thirsty, the strangers, the naked, the sick, the prisoners (Matthew 25:31-40). ‘Judgement’ is simply a way of saying that God will uncover all that already is. We participate in this ‘judgement’ even now by the small and large choices we make in coming to be who we are. ‘Judgement’ is God revealing who we are. The social and human sciences have taught us that human beings are complex realities, and only God knows the true and false motives of the human heart. For this reason, we need to avoid a ‘juridical’ sense of the term. The same God who has been the spoken and unspoken reality of our lives – the known and unknown mover and shaper – is the same God who greets us in justice, love and mercy. ‘Judgement’ is the moment of revelation of our true selves before our Creator.",
            "It is also pointless to try to give a pictorial description of what heaven will be like. From God’s word, we can conclude that even though the final ‘bodily’ resurrection of believers will take place only at the end of time, our enjoyment of the presence of God in heaven will begin when we experience God’s favourable judgement at the moment of death.",
            "What we can say of heaven is that it will be a perfect sharing in God’s loving presence for all eternity. The love we feel for another person here on earth is only a shadow of the love we will experience when we come into the unveiled presence of God. Paul knew that the happiness of heaven could not be expressed in words. Speaking of the glory of heaven he wrote: What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the human heart conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him (1 Corinthians 2:9) and John wrote: Beloved, we are God’s children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this: when he is revealed, we will be like him, for we will see him as he is (1 John 3:2).",
            "The official teaching of the Church is that there is a Purgatory and that the souls detained in this state are helped by our prayers, especially by the offering of the Eucharist on their behalf. The Church does not have anything to say about its duration. Indeed duration in purgatory is a real problem, because in the hereafter, time no longer exists. Certainly we must not imagine Purgatory to be a kind of concentration camp or a temporary hell. It is blasphemous to think of God as demanding the last pound of flesh.",
            "The word comes from a Latin term meaning purifying or cleansing. It seems preferable to think of purgatory not in terms of time or place or punishment, but in terms of a purifying process. It is the painful aspect of the passage from this life into God’s loving presence. At the moment of death, we are confronted with God and all the infinite love and holiness of God. In the light of this, many of us – if not all of us – will painfully and shamefully become aware of our weakness and sinfulness. In the light of God’s utter goodness, we can only acknowledge that which is darkness and sin within us. It is easy to imagine how at this passage from death to life, we will have to pass through the ‘purifying fire’ of God’s love.",
            "The Church celebrates All Souls’ Day on November 2nd. On this day we pray for our relatives, friends and others who have passed from this life to eternity. The Church teaches that the dead may profit from our prayers as they pass through purgatory. This practice of praying for the dead is mentioned in the pre-Christian book of Maccabees (2 Maccabees 12:43-46).",
            "If we understand purgatory not in terms of a time of detention, but in terms of a passage from the selfishness of this life to the full love of heaven, we might ask how our prayers benefit the dead. We do not know precisely how our prayers help those who experience purgatory. But we pray with faith, believing that somehow in God’s goodness and in the mystery of eternity, our prayers have made their passage to God less painful.",
            "It is helpful to understand that all prayer is ultimately a gift inspired by the Spirit and that all our prayers share in the great prayer and intercession of Christ. The living and dead are bound by a communion of love – not by time and space. We do not pray for those who have died in order to persuade God to be more merciful. Rather, God inspires us to pray so that we might share in the salvation of each other.",
            "Many Christians have already begun the process of preparing for death in their own lives, since they see their eternal destiny always before them. Paul shares with us the insight of a man who has already accepted the fact of his death, and who even looks forward to that moment with some longing: For to me, living is Christ and dying is gain. If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labour for me; and I do not know which I prefer. I am hard pressed between the two: my desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better; but to remain in the flesh is more necessary for you. (Philippians 1:21-24)."

In the Garden of Gethsemane, he prayed to his Father to release him from this obligation. Mindful of this we need not feel guilty about our own natural fear of death, for there need be nothing un-Christian about it. Nor is it un-Christian to grieve for loved ones who have died. Although we accept in faith that they are now enjoying eternal life with Christ, grief, loneliness and sadness are natural human emotions. Grieving in fact is a healthy and necessary part of our human condition. In time, grief becomes a loving memory. The faith that leads to our own hope of resurrection will also be our source of strength in time of grief.",

In the first place, it needs to be recognised that this occasion will indeed be a dreadful experience for those who have deliberately chosen to live without God. Secondly, these biblical accounts of the judgement are framed in a particular form of writing current at the time, called ‘apocalyptic’, and should not be taken as a literal description of the event.",

At that same moment, we are brought face to face with the truth of our lives and see ourselves as having either accepted or rejected God by the way we have lived. As a result of the virtues that we have cultivated and the fundamental choices that we have made, our eternal destiny – heaven or hell – is determined. It is not so much that God sends a person to hell – no, a person chooses hell by their own free will. We ultimately choose to live a life orientated towards God and others or a life orientated towards ourselves.",
            "The person whose earthly life has been an existence without love, selfishly turned in upon himself or herself, heedless of God or the things of the Spirit, will be simply incapable of choosing God at the moment of truth. He or she will inevitably continue that state of rejection of God, unable to do otherwise. They are frozen in their own life choice, a life choice shaped by many decisions freely made along the way.",

For one who has died in spirit long before, it is the moment when the fundamental decision is signed and sealed. Hell is living with that decision forever. It is no reflection on the love and mercy of God. God has done everything possible to save, except to take away human freedom.",
            "Hell consists in a state of deep, burning loneliness or alienation from God. In the Scriptures it is often described in terms of an eternal fire, e.g. Matthew 25:41. There can of course be no material fire in a spiritual state of existence. This biblical imagery is chosen to emphasise the horror of the pain of hell, which really consists in the irrevocable loss of God, for whom each person is created.",
            "The Bible does not tell us whether any person has in fact been condemned, or condemned himself to hell. It is not said explicitly, even of Judas, that he is in that state, though Jesus did remark in ominous words: It would have been better for that one not to have been born (Matthew 26:24). It might be argued that no one in his right mind would make the kind of fundamental decision against God, which we have described. Certainly, we may hope that those condemned for eternity represent a proportionately small group of humanity. But how many and who in particular are in hell is not for us to judge – this is something known only to God.",
            "Jesus warned us against judging others (Matthew 7:1-2). We have no way of entering into another person’s conscience or of understanding why people act the way they do. We can judge that certain actions – like murder – are evil in themselves, but whether the person who performs that action is guilty of sin is beyond our power to judge. We cannot know the extent of a person’s full responsibility or state of mind when he or she so acts.",
            "Turning again to theologian Anthony Kelly, he strikingly (and perhaps shockingly) declares that Christians must hope that hell exists. Why? This is not because we look forward to the damnation of any human being, but rather we look to the final state in which evil will be revealed for what it is and brought to nothing. Hell looks to the point at which there will be no more room for hatreds and violence ... It forbids any representation of God’s love as tolerance of evil or a compromise with it. Hell is where evil is contained, rendered impotent, and made to serve the higher purposes of a good creation ... Evil will be disclosed as a parasite living off the original good of creation. We know from our own lives and human history that evil exists. Our understanding of the term ‘hell’ encompasses both our recognition of the reality of evil and our hope that evil will be ultimately overcome by God.",

It is a term not found in the Scriptures and remains one of the points of disagreement between Catholics and Protestants. It is important therefore to understand exactly what the Church teaches on the subject.",
            "The pain of purgatory has nothing in common with the pain of hell. It is rather the pain of wanting to be made totally worthy of union with God. In the light of God’s love we will know that we have not cut ourselves off completely, but we will also be brought face-to-face with the selfishness and the turning away from God in minor ways, which have marked our journey through this life.",
            "Purgatory then will be the experience of people who know they are saved and invited into God’s presence for all eternity, but know also that for this step to be taken, they need to be purified by the fire of God’s love.",
            "It is possible that some people are completely purified in this life. Our present existence is a form of purgatory, as we die daily to whatever is selfish, untrue, un-Christlike, and are daily being raised up by Christ to share more deeply in his life. For those who are fully open to Christ’s purifying action in this life, purgatory is already negotiated."
