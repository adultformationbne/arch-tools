## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Notes

### Current Architecture
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit with Svelte 5 runes syntax
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with ACCF color system
- **Icons**: Lucide Svelte
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- **Deployment**: Vercel

### Code Quality Standards
- All components use Svelte 5 syntax (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`)
- Components avoid horizontal margins (parent controls spacing)
- ACCF design system colors and typography
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Proper TypeScript integration

### Database Design Principles
- Immutable audit trails for all admin actions
- Row Level Security for data isolation
- Proper indexing for performance
- Cohort-based data segregation

## üìã Immediate Next Steps

### Phase 2 Kickoff (Database Integration)
1. **Design Database Schema**
   - Map current mock data structures to Supabase tables
   - Define relationships and constraints
   - Plan RLS policies for each table

2. **Authentication Setup**
   - Configure Supabase Auth providers
   - Implement role-based redirects
   - Create user management interface

3. **Data Migration Strategy**
   - Plan data import procedures
   - Create seed data for testing
   - Design backup and recovery procedures

### Development Workflow
1. Create feature branches for each major component
2. Test with realistic data volumes
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Add loading states and user feedback
5. Conduct security review before production

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Phase 2 Completion Criteria
- [ ] All admin pages connected to real database
- [ ] Authentication working with proper role separation
- [ ] Student can enroll and admin can see enrollment
- [ ] Reflection submission and marking workflow complete

### Phase 3 Completion Criteria
- [ ] Email notifications functional
- [ ] Reporting dashboard operational
- [ ] File upload system working
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## üîç Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Performance**: Plan for proper indexing and query optimization
- **Authentication Security**: Implement proper RLS and audit logging
- **Data Migration**: Create comprehensive backup and rollback procedures

### User Experience Risks
- **Learning Curve**: Provide clear documentation and training materials
- **Mobile Usability**: Ensure all admin functions work well on tablets
- **Data Loss Prevention**: Implement auto-save and confirmation dialogs
