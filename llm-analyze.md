# LLM Content Analysis System

## Overview

This system uses a local LLM (Ollama with Llama 3.2) to systematically analyze religious education content from "At Home With God's People" to determine what should be kept or removed for modern RCIA candidates. The system includes an **interactive web dashboard** for filtering, visualizing, and exporting analysis results.

## The Problem We're Solving

The original book contains extensive content that may not be suitable for modern readers new to faith. We need to identify:
- **Content to KEEP**: Highly relatable, accessible, emotionally engaging material
- **Content to REMOVE**: Overly historical, complex theological, or dry instructional material
- **Content to MODIFY**: Material with potential but needs editing

## How It Works

### 1. Content Selection
- **Only analyzes paragraph blocks** - the main body content
- **Skips Introduction chapter** - focuses on actual religious education content (Chapter 1+)
- **Ignores headers, lists, and metadata** - concentrates on readable text

### 2. LLM Analysis Process
Each paragraph gets sent to the local LLM using an improved **"focus group moderator"** prompt that simulates real human reactions:

```
Text: "Part of being human is to be always searching for happiness..."

The LLM returns:
{
  "relatability": 7,
  "historical_focus": 3, 
  "theological_depth": 4,
  "practical_application": 6,
  "accessibility": 5,
  "emotional_resonance": 8,
  "key_themes": ["human search", "happiness", "personal experience"],
  "content_type_analysis": "Universal human experience that most people can relate to..."
}
```

**🎯 Key Improvement**: Our refined prompt asks the LLM to imagine being a focus group moderator with 10 regular people (teachers, nurses, mechanics) who know little about Catholicism. This produces much more realistic scores.

### 3. Scoring Dimensions (1-10 Scale)

#### **Relatability** (1-10)
- **What it measures**: Can readers see themselves in this content?
- **High scores (8-10)**: Uses "you" language, personal examples, universal human experiences
- **Low scores (1-3)**: Abstract concepts, purely factual teaching, no personal connection
- **Example High**: "Part of being human is to be always searching for happiness"
- **Example Low**: "The Council of Trent established the following doctrinal positions"

#### **Historical Focus** (1-10)
- **What it measures**: How much does this focus on past events/figures?
- **High scores (8-10)**: Early Church history, historical figures, "how we got here" explanations
- **Low scores (1-3)**: Present-day application, timeless concepts, personal spirituality
- **Example High**: "In 325 AD, the Council of Nicaea addressed the Arian controversy"
- **Example Low**: "Prayer is our way of connecting with God in daily life"

#### **Theological Depth** (1-10)
- **What it measures**: How complex and advanced is the religious content?
- **High scores (8-10)**: Complex doctrines, requires theological background, advanced concepts
- **Low scores (1-3)**: Simple spiritual concepts, basic faith ideas, accessible to beginners
- **Example High**: "The hypostatic union of Christ's divine and human natures"
- **Example Low**: "God loves each of us personally"

#### **Practical Application** (1-10)
- **What it measures**: How directly usable is this in daily life?
- **High scores (8-10)**: Actionable guidance, prayer suggestions, life practices, "do this" content
- **Low scores (1-3)**: Purely informational, no actionable elements, theoretical only
- **Example High**: "Ask your sponsor to share their faith journey with you"
- **Example Low**: "The structure of Church hierarchy includes bishops, priests, and deacons"

#### **Accessibility** (1-10)
- **What it measures**: How easy for religious beginners to understand?
- **High scores (8-10)**: Simple language, basic concepts, no religious jargon
- **Low scores (1-3)**: Complex vocabulary, assumes religious knowledge, jargon-heavy
- **Example High**: "Open your heart to God's love"
- **Example Low**: "The episcopate exercises collegial authority in communion with the papal magisterium"

#### **Emotional Resonance** (1-10)
- **What it measures**: How emotionally engaging and moving is this?
- **High scores (8-10)**: Touches the heart, inspires, comforts, connects to universal emotions
- **Low scores (1-3)**: Dry factual material, no emotional connection, purely academic
- **Example High**: "God is with you in your struggles and celebrates your joys"
- **Example Low**: "Canon law stipulates the following requirements for marriage"

### 4. Improved Scale Interpretation

**Our refined 1-10 scale now produces realistic distributions:**
- **1-3**: Strongly NOT suitable for modern RCIA candidates
- **4-6**: Neutral/mixed - might work with editing  
- **7-10**: Strongly suitable for modern RCIA candidates

**✅ Fixed Score Inflation**: The improved prompt now produces scores across the full 1-10 range instead of clustering at 8-10.

**Real Examples from Current Data:**
- **Technical RCIA procedures**: relatability 3, emotional resonance 1-2 (appropriately low)
- **Universal human experiences**: relatability 7, emotional resonance 8 (realistically high)
- **Complex theological arguments**: accessibility 3-4, theological depth 7-8 (properly calibrated)

## Content Filtering Strategy

### **🟢 KEEP** - Content with:
- High relatability (6+) AND high accessibility (7+) AND low theological complexity (≤6)
- **Example**: Universal human experiences, simple spiritual concepts, "you" language

### **🔴 REMOVE** - Content with:
- Low relatability (≤3) OR low emotional resonance (≤2)
- Very high theological depth (8+) AND low accessibility (≤4)
- **Example**: Academic theology discussions, complex historical arguments, procedural instructions

### **🟡 EDIT** - Everything else:
- Mixed scores with editing potential
- Good core message but poor accessibility
- Historical content that could be made more relatable

**Automated Classification**: The web dashboard automatically categorizes all content using these rules and provides visual recommendations.
